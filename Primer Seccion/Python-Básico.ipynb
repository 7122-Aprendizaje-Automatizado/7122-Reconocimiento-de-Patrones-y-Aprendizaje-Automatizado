The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices\\r\\nwhich protuded from it at unsightly angles would have  disfigured\\r\\nthe  looks  of  most  ships,  but  in  this  case  that was sadly\\r\\nimpossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not\\r\\nby reliable witnesses.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship  you  would\\r\\nhave  to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however,\\r\\nthis is precisely what you will avoid doing because  the  average\\r\\nVogon  will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly\\r\\nhideous to you that you will wish you had never been  born  -  or\\r\\n(if  you  are  a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never\\r\\nbeen born.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn fact, the average Vogon probably  wouldn\\'t  even  think  once.\\r\\nThey are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and\\r\\nthinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical\\r\\nanalysis  of  the  Vogon  reveals that its brain was originally a\\r\\nbadly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest  thing\\r\\nyou  can  say about them, then, is that they know what they like,\\r\\nand  what  they  like  generally  involves  hurting  people  and,\\r\\nwherever possible, getting very angry.\\r\\n \\r\\nOne  thing  they  don\\'t  like  is  leaving  a  job  unfinished  -\\r\\nparticularly this Vogon, and particularly - for various reasons -\\r\\nthis job.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic\\r\\nHyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of\\r\\ndemolishing the so-called \"planet\" Earth.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe heaved his monumentally vile body round  in  his  ill-fitting,\\r\\nslimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship\\r\\nHeart of Gold was being systematically scanned.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt mattered little to him  that  the  Heart  of  Gold,  with  its\\r\\nInfinite   Improbability   Drive,  was  the  most  beautiful  and\\r\\nrevolutionary ship ever built.  Aesthetics  and  technology  were\\r\\nclosed  books  to  him  and, had he had his way, burnt and buried\\r\\nbooks as well.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox  was  aboard.\\r\\nZaphod  Beeblebrox  was  now  the ex-President of the Galaxy, and\\r\\nthough every police force in the Galaxy  was  currently  pursuing\\r\\nboth  him  and  this  ship  he  had  stolen,  the  Vogon  was not\\r\\ninterested.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe had other fish to fry.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt has been said that Vogons are not above a little  bribery  and\\r\\ncorruption  in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds,\\r\\nand this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the  words\\r\\n\"integrity\"  or \"moral rectitude\", he reached for his dictionary,\\r\\nand when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he\\r\\nreached for the rule book and threw it away.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn seeking so implacably the destruction of  the  Earth  and  all\\r\\nthat therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call\\r\\nof his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether\\r\\nthe  said  bypass  was actually going to be built, but the matter\\r\\nhad been glossed over.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Computer,\" he croaked, \"get me my brain care specialist  on  the\\r\\nline.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nWithin a few seconds the face of Gag  Halfrunt  appeared  on  the\\r\\nscreen,  smiling  the  smile  of  a man who knew he was ten light\\r\\nyears away from the Vogon  face  he  was  looking  at.  Mixed  up\\r\\nsomewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon\\r\\npersistently  referred  to  him  as  \"my   private   brain   care\\r\\nspecialist\"  there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it\\r\\nwas in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He  was  paying\\r\\nhim  an  awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of\\r\\nthe Galaxy\\'s most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he  and\\r\\na  consortium  of  his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an\\r\\nawful lot of money when it  seemed  that  the  entire  future  of\\r\\npsychiatry might be at stake.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and  how\\r\\nare we feeling today?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Vogon captain told him that in the  last  few  hours  he  had\\r\\nwiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise.\\r\\n \\r\\nHalfrunt\\'s smile did not flicker for an instant.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I think this is perfectly normal behaviour  for\\r\\na  Vogon,  you  know?  The natural and healthy channelling of the\\r\\naggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That,\" rumbled the Vogon, \"is what you always say.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well again,\" said Halfrunt, \"I  think  that  this  is  perfectly\\r\\nnormal  behaviour  for  a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both\\r\\nvery well adjusted in our mental attitudes today.  Now  tell  me,\\r\\nwhat news of the mission?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We have located the ship.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Wonderful,\" said Halfrunt, \"wonderful! and the occupants?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The Earthman is there.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Excellent! And ...?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A female from the same planet. They are the last.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good, good,\" beamed Halfrunt, \"Who else?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The man Prefect.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And Zaphod Beeblebrox.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFor an instant Halfrunt\\'s smile flickered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah yes,\" he said,  \"I  had  been  expecting  this.  It  is  most\\r\\nregrettable.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A personal friend?\"  inquired  the  Vogon,  who  had  heard  the\\r\\nexpression somewhere once and decided to try it out.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, no,\" said Halfrunt, \"in my profession you know,  we  do  not\\r\\nmake personal friends.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" grunted the Vogon, \"professional detachment.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Halfrunt cheerfully, \"we just don\\'t have the knack.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe paused. His mouth continued to smile,  but  his  eyes  frowned\\r\\nslightly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But Beeblebrox, you know,\" he  said,  \"he  is  one  of  my  most\\r\\nprofitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams\\r\\nof analysts.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing\\r\\nit.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Still,\" he said, \"you are ready for your task?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good. Destroy the ship immediately.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What about Beeblebrox?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" said Halfrunt brightly,  \"Zaphod\\'s  just  this  guy,  you\\r\\nknow?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe vanished from the screen.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button  which  connected\\r\\nhim with the remains of his crew.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Attack,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt that  precise  moment  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  in  his  cabin\\r\\nswearing  very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would\\r\\ngo for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe,\\r\\nwhereupon  he  had had a blazing row with the ship\\'s computer and\\r\\nstormed off to his cabin shouting that  he  would  work  out  the\\r\\nImprobability factors with a pencil.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Heart of Gold\\'s Improbability Drive made it the most powerful\\r\\nand  unpredictable  ship  in  existence.  There  was  nothing  it\\r\\ncouldn\\'t do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that\\r\\nthe thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching\\r\\nit.  He  didn\\'t know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he\\r\\nliked it.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe didn\\'t know why he had become President of the Galaxy,  except\\r\\nthat it seemed a fun thing to be.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe did know that there were better reasons than these,  but  that\\r\\nthey were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains.\\r\\nHe wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go\\r\\naway  because  they  occasionally  surfaced  momentarily  and put\\r\\nstrange thoughts into the light, fun sections  of  his  mind  and\\r\\ntried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business\\r\\nof his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time.  He  had\\r\\nrun out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Starpox!\" he shouted.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in  mid  air.  This\\r\\nwas  not  because  of  anything  wrong with the ship\\'s artificial\\r\\ngravity field, but because he was  leaping  down  the  stair-well\\r\\nwhich  led to the ship\\'s personal cabins. It was a very high jump\\r\\nto do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled,  recovered,\\r\\nraced  down  the  corridor  sending a couple of miniature service\\r\\nrobots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod\\'s door\\r\\nand explained what was on his mind.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Vogons,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nA short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin\\r\\nin  search  of  a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon\\r\\nwith a great deal of optimism., because he  knew  that  the  only\\r\\nsource  of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of\\r\\nequipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It  was\\r\\ncalled  a  Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered\\r\\nit before.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt claimed  to  produce  the  widest  possible  range  of  drinks\\r\\npersonally  matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared\\r\\nto use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably  produced\\r\\na  plastic  cup  filled  with  a  liquid that was almost, but nit\\r\\nquite, entirely unlike tea.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe attempted to reason with the thing.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Tea,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Share and Enjoy,\" the machine replied and provided him with  yet\\r\\nanother cup of the sickly liquid.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe threw it away.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Share and enjoy,\" the machine repeated  and  provided  him  with\\r\\nanother one.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Share and Enjoy\" is the company motto of the  hugely  successful\\r\\nSirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Complaints  division, which now\\r\\ncovers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is\\r\\nthe  only  part  of  the  Corporation  to have shown a consistent\\r\\nprofit in recent years.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe motto  stands  -  or  rather  stood  -  in  three  mile  high\\r\\nilluminated  letters  near the Complaints Department spaceport on\\r\\nEadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly  after  it\\r\\nwas  erected,  the  ground  beneath the letters caved in and they\\r\\ndropped for nearly half their length through the offices of  many\\r\\ntalented young complaints executives - now deceased.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe protruding upper halves of the letters  now  appear,  in  the\\r\\nlocal language, to read \"Go stick your head in a pig\", and are no\\r\\nlonger illuminated, except at times of special celebration.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Listen, you machine,\" he said, \"you claim you can synthesize any\\r\\ndrink  in  existence,  so  why  do  you  keep  giving me the same\\r\\nundrinkable stuff?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nutrition and pleasurable  sense  data,\"  burbled  the  machine.\\r\\n\"Share and Enjoy.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It tastes filthy!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink,\" continued the\\r\\nmachine, \"why not share it with your friends?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Because,\" said Arthur tartly, \"I want to keep them. Will you try\\r\\nto comprehend what I\\'m telling you? That drink ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That  drink,\"  said  the  machine  sweetly,  \"was   individually\\r\\ntailored  to  meet  your  personal requirements for nutrition and\\r\\npleasure.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Arthur, \"so I\\'m a masochist on diet am I?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Share and Enjoy.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh shut up.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Will that be all?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur decided to give up.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nThen he decided he\\'d be dammed if he\\'d give up.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" he said, \"look, it\\'s very, very simple ... all I  want  ...\\r\\nis a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and\\r\\nlisten.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about\\r\\nChina,  he  told  it  about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves\\r\\ndrying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots.  He  told  it\\r\\nabout  summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in\\r\\nthe milk before the tea so it wouldn\\'t get scalded. He even  told\\r\\nit (briefly) about the history of the East India Company.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So that\\'s it, is it?\" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Arthur, \"that is what I want.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, yes. With milk.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Squirted out of a cow?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m going to need some help with this  one,\"  said  the  machine\\r\\ntersely.  All  the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice\\r\\nand it now meant business.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, anything I can do,\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'ve done quite enough,\" the Nutri-Matic informed him.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt summoned up the ship\\'s computer.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hi there!\" said the ship\\'s computer.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship\\'s  computer.  The\\r\\ncomputer  boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and\\r\\ntogether they lapsed into a grim silence.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur watched and  waited  for  a  while,  but  nothing  further\\r\\nhappened.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe thumped it, but still nothing happened.\\r\\n \\r\\nEventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the empty wastes of space,  the  Heart  of  Gold  hung  still.\\r\\nAround  it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it\\r\\ncrept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Does anyone have a kettle?\" Arthur asked as he walked on to  the\\r\\nbridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at\\r\\nthe computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod  was\\r\\nkicking  it,  and  also  why there was a nasty yellow lump on the\\r\\nvision screen.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe put down the empty cup he was  carrying  and  walked  over  to\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the  polished  marble\\r\\nsurfaces  that  contained  the  instruments  that  controlled the\\r\\nconventional photon drive. They materialized  beneath  his  hands\\r\\nand  he  flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he\\r\\npressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly  judder  and\\r\\ncut out again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Something up?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, didja hear that?\" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now  for  the\\r\\nmanual  controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, \"the monkey\\r\\nspoke!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then  also  cut\\r\\nout.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pure history,  man,\"  said  Zaphod,  kicking  the  Improbability\\r\\nDrive, \"a talking monkey!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If you\\'re upset about something ...\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Vogons!\" snapped Ford, \"we\\'re under attack!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur gibbered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well what are you doing? Let\\'s get out of here!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Can\\'t. Computer\\'s jammed.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Jammed?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It says all its circuits are occupied. There\\'s no power anywhere\\r\\nin the ship.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across\\r\\nhis forehead and slumped back against the wall.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nothing we can do,\" he said. He glared at nothing  and  bit  his\\r\\nlip.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the  Earth  had\\r\\nbeen demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at\\r\\nall good at it, and his particular speciality  had  been  scoring\\r\\nown goals in important matches. Whenever this happened he used to\\r\\nexperience a peculiar tingling round the back of  his  neck  that\\r\\nwould  slowly  creep  up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The\\r\\nimage of mud and grass and lots of little jeering  boys  flinging\\r\\nit at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment.\\r\\n \\r\\nA peculiar tingling  sensation  at  the  back  of  his  neck  was\\r\\ncreeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe started to speak, and stopped.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe started to speak again and stopped again.\\r\\n \\r\\nFinally he managed to speak.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er,\" he said. He cleared his throat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Tell me,\" he continued, and said it so nervously that the others\\r\\nall  turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow\\r\\nblob on the vision screen.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Tell me,\"  he  said  again,  \"did  the  computer  say  what  was\\r\\noccupying it? I just ask out of interest ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nTheir eyes were riveted on him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And, er ... well that\\'s it really, just asking.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?\" he breathed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" said Arthur, \"nothing in fact. It\\'s just that I  think  a\\r\\nshort while ago it was trying to work out how to ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Make me some tea.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s right guys,\" the computer sang out suddenly, \"just coping\\r\\nwith  that  problem right now, and wow, it\\'s a biggy. Be with you\\r\\nin a while.\" It lapsed back into a silence that was only  matched\\r\\nfor sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at\\r\\nArthur Dent.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs if to relieve the tension, the Vogons  chose  that  moment  to\\r\\nstart firing.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship shook, the  ship  thundered.  Outside,  the  inch  thick\\r\\nforce-shield  around  it  blistered,  crackled and spat under the\\r\\nbarrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon,  and\\r\\nlooked  as if it wouldn\\'t be around for long. Four minutes is how\\r\\nlong Ford Prefect gave it.\"Three minutes and fifty  seconds,\"  he\\r\\nsaid a short while later.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Forty-five seconds,\"  he  added  at  the  appropriate  time.  He\\r\\nflicked  idly  at  some  useless  switches,  then  gave Arthur an\\r\\nunfriendly look.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?\" he said. \"Three minutes  and  forty\\r\\nseconds.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Will you stop counting!\" snarled Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Ford  Prefect,  \"in  three  minutes  and  thirty-five\\r\\nseconds.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. He had\\r\\nexpected  a  chase,  he  had  expected  an  exciting grapple with\\r\\ntractor beams, he had expected  to  have  to  use  the  specially\\r\\ninstalled Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Heart\\r\\nof  Gold\\'s  Infinite  Improbability  Drive,  but  the  Sub-Cyclic\\r\\nNormality  Assert-i-Tron  lay  idle as the Heart of Gold just sat\\r\\nthere and took it.\\r\\n \\r\\nA dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil  Photrazon  Cannon  continued  to\\r\\nblaze  away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and\\r\\ntook it.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe tested every sensor at his disposal to see if  there  was  any\\r\\nsubtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe didn\\'t know about the tea of course.\\r\\n \\r\\nNor did he know exactly how the occupants of the  Heart  of  Gold\\r\\nwere  spending  the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life\\r\\nthey had left to spend.\\r\\n \\r\\nQuite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at  the  idea  of  holding  a\\r\\nseance at this point is something he was never quite clear on.\\r\\n \\r\\nObviously the subject of death  was  in  the  air,  but  more  as\\r\\nsomething to be avoided than harped upon.\\r\\n \\r\\nPossibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at  the  prospect  of\\r\\nbeing  reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought\\r\\nthat they might just feel the same  way  about  him  and,  what\\'s\\r\\nmore,  be  able  to  do  something about helping to postpone this\\r\\nreunion.\\r\\n \\r\\nOr again it might just have been one of  the  strange  promptings\\r\\nthat  occasionally  surfaced from that dark area of his mind that\\r\\nhe had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the\\r\\nGalaxy.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You want to talk to your great grandfather?\" boggled Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Does it have to be now?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship continued to shake  and  thunder.  The  temperature  was\\r\\nrising.  The  light  was  getting  dimmer  -  all  the energy the\\r\\ncomputer didn\\'t require for thinking about tea was  being  pumped\\r\\ninto the rapidly fading force-field.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah!\" insisted Zaphod. \"Listen Ford, I think he may be able  to\\r\\nhelp us.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Suggest something else we can do.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, well ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK,  round  the  central  console.  Now.  Come   on!   Trillian,\\r\\nMonkeyman, move.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey clustered round the central console in confusion,  sat  down\\r\\nand,  feeling  exceptionally  foolish, held hands. With his third\\r\\nhand Zaphod turned off the lights.\\r\\n \\r\\nDarkness gripped the ship.\\r\\n \\r\\nOutside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon  continued\\r\\nto rip at the force-field.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Concentrate,\" hissed Zaphod, \"on his name.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What is it?\" asked Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The Fourth?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah. Listen,  I\\'m  Zaphod  Beeblebrox,  my  father  was  Zaphod\\r\\nBeeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There was an accident with a contraceptive and a  time  machine.\\r\\nNow concentrate!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Three minutes,\" said Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why,\" said Arthur Dent, \"are we doing this?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Shut up,\" suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox.\\r\\n \\r\\nTrillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say?\\r\\n \\r\\nThe only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a\\r\\nfar  corner  where  Marvin  the  Paranoid  Android  sat  slumped,\\r\\nignoring all  and  ignored  by  all,  in  a  private  and  rather\\r\\nunpleasant world of his own.\\r\\n \\r\\nRound  the  central  console  four  figures  hunched   in   tight\\r\\nconcentration  trying  to  blot  from  their minds the terrifying\\r\\nshuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that  echoed  through\\r\\nit.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey concentrated.\\r\\n \\r\\nStill they concentrated.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd still they concentrated.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe seconds ticked by.\\r\\n \\r\\nOn Zaphod\\'s brow stood beads of sweat,  first  of  concentration,\\r\\nthen of frustration and finally of embarrassment.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his  hands  from\\r\\nTrillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, I was beginning to think you\\'d never turn  the  lights  on,\"\\r\\nsaid  a  voice.  \"No,  not too bright please, my eyes aren\\'t what\\r\\nthey once were.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFour figures jolted upright in their seats.  Slowly  they  turned\\r\\ntheir  heads  to  look,  though  their  scalps  showed a distinct\\r\\npropensity to try and stay in the same place.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Now. Who disturbs me at this time?\" said the small, bent,  gaunt\\r\\nfigure  standing  by  the  sprays  of  fern at the far end of the\\r\\nbridge. His two small wispy-haired heads looked so  ancient  that\\r\\nit  seemed  they  might  hold  dim  memories  of the birth of the\\r\\ngalaxies themselves. One lolled in sleep, but the other  squinted\\r\\nsharply  at  them.  If his eyes weren\\'t what they once were, they\\r\\nmust once have been diamond cutters.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. He  gave  the  intricate\\r\\nlittle  double  nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture\\r\\nof familial respect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh ... er, hi Great Granddad ...\" he breathed.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe little old  figure  moved  closer  towards  them.  He  peered\\r\\nthrough  the  dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great\\r\\ngrandson.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" he snapped. \"Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line.\\r\\nZaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The First.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The Nothingth,\" spat the figure.  Zaphod  hated  his  voice.  It\\r\\nalways  seemed  to  him  to  screech  like fingernails across the\\r\\nblackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe shifted awkwardly in his seat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, yeah,\" he muttered, \"Er, look, I\\'m really  sorry  about  the\\r\\nflowers,  I  meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was\\r\\nfresh out of wreaths and ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You forget!\" snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Too busy. Never think of other people. The living  are  all  the\\r\\nsame.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Two minutes, Zaphod,\" whispered Ford in an awed whisper.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod fidgeted nervously.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, but I did mean to send them,\" he said. \"And I\\'ll write  to\\r\\nmy  great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Your great  grandmother,\"  mused  the  gaunt  little  figure  to\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod, \"Er, how is she? Tell you what, I\\'ll go  and\\r\\nsee her. But first we\\'ve just got to ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Your late great grandmother and I are very well,\" rasped  Zaphod\\r\\nBeeblebrox the Fourth.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah. Oh.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah well ...\" Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of\\r\\nthis  conversation,  and  Ford\\'s heavy breathing at his side told\\r\\nhim that the seconds were ticking away fast. The  noise  and  the\\r\\nshaking  had  reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and\\r\\nArthur\\'s faces white and unblinking in the gloom.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, Great Grandfather ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We\\'ve been following your progress with considerable despondency\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, look, just at the moment you see ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Not to say contempt!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Could you sort of listen for a moment ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m being attacked by a Vogon fleet!\" cried Zaphod.  It  was  an\\r\\nexaggeration,  but  it was his only opportunity so far of getting\\r\\nthe basic point of the exercise across.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Doesn\\'t surprise me in the least,\" said the  little  old  figure\\r\\nwith a shrug.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Only  it\\'s  happening  right  now  you  see,\"  insisted   Zaphod\\r\\nfeverishly.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur  Dent  had\\r\\nbrought in and looked at it with interest.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er ... Great Granddad ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Did you know,\" interrupting the ghostly  figure,  fixing  Zaphod\\r\\nwith  a  stern  look,  \"that Betelgeuse Five has developed a very\\r\\nslight eccentricy in its orbit?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod didn\\'t and found the information hard  to  concentrate  on\\r\\nwhat with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, no ... look,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Me spinning in my grave!\" barked the ancestor.  He  slammed  the\\r\\ncup  down  and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger\\r\\nat Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Your fault!\" he screeched.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"One minute thirty,\" muttered Ford, his head in his hands.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Help?\" exclaimed the old man as if he\\'d been asked for a stoat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Help!\" repeated the old man as if he\\'d been asked for a  lightly\\r\\ngrilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You go swanning your way round the Galaxy  with  your  ...\"  the\\r\\nancestor  waved  a  contemptuous  hand,  \"with  your disreputable\\r\\nfriends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones  would\\r\\nhave  done,  would  have been quite appropriate from you, but no.\\r\\nToo busy. Too modern. Too sceptical  -  till  you  suddenly  find\\r\\nyourself  in  a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally-\\r\\nminded!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe shook his head - carefully, so as not to disturb  the  slumber\\r\\nof the other one, which was already becoming restive.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know, young Zaphod,\" he continued, \"I  think  I\\'ll\\r\\nhave to think about this one.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"One minute ten,\" said Ford hollowly.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why does that man keep talking in numbers?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Those numbers,\" said Zaphod tersely, \"are  the  time  we\\'ve  got\\r\\nleft to live.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh,\" said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. \"Doesn\\'t\\r\\napply to me, of course,\" he said and moved off to a dimmer recess\\r\\nof the bridge in search of something else to poke around at.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and  wondered\\r\\nif he shouldn\\'t just jump over and have done with it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Great Grandfather,\" he said, \"It applies to  us!  We  are  still\\r\\nalive, and we are about to lose our lives.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good job too.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What use is your life to anyone? When I  think  of  what  you\\'ve\\r\\nmade of it the phrase `pig\\'s ear\\' comes irresistibly to my mind.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Huh,\" muttered his ancestor, \"And what kind of a job is that for\\r\\na Beeblebrox?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Conceited little megapuppy.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod blinked in bewilderment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and\\r\\ntapped  him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding\\r\\nZaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he  didn\\'t  feel  a\\r\\nthing.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You know and I know what being President  means,  young  Zaphod.\\r\\nYou  know because you\\'ve been it, and I know because I\\'m dead and\\r\\nit gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We  have\\r\\na saying up here. `Life is wasted on the living.\\'\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod bitterly, \"very good. Very deep. Right now  I\\r\\nneed aphorisms like I need holes in my heads.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Fifty seconds,\" grunted Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where was I?\" said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pontificating,\" said Zaphod Beeblebrox.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Can this guy,\" muttered Ford quietly  to  Zaphod,  \"actually  in\\r\\nfact help us?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nobody else can,\" whispered Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord nodded despondently.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod!\" the ghost was saying,  \"you  became  President  of  the\\r\\nGalaxy for a reason. Have you forgotten?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Could we go into this later?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Have you forgotten!\" insisted the ghost.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had  to  forget.  They  screen  your\\r\\nbrain when you get the job you know. If they\\'d found my head full\\r\\nof tricksy ideas I\\'d have been right out  on  the  streets  again\\r\\nwith  nothing  but  a  fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of\\r\\nships and a couple of slit throats.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" nodded the ghost in satisfaction, \"then you do remember!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe paused for a moment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good,\" he said and the noise stopped.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Forty-eight seconds,\" said Ford. He looked again  at  his  watch\\r\\nand tapped it. He looked up.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, the noise has stopped,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nA mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost\\'s hard little eyes.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ve slowed down time for a moment,\" he said, \"just for a moment\\r\\nyou understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, you listen to me, you  see-through  old  bat,\"  said  Zaphod\\r\\nleaping  out  of his chair, \"A - thanks for stopping time and all\\r\\nthat, great, terrific, wonderful, but  B  -  no  thanks  for  the\\r\\nhomily, right? I don\\'t know what this great think I\\'m meant to be\\r\\ndoing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed  not  to  know.\\r\\nAnd I resent that, right?\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except\\r\\nthat the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own\\r\\nbrain - my own brain - and locked off  the  bits  that  knew  and\\r\\ncared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn\\'t be able to do it. I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t be able to go and be President, and I wouldn\\'t  be  able\\r\\nto steal this ship, which must be the important thing.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn\\'t  he,  by\\r\\nchanging  my  brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its\\r\\nown choices to make, and by a strange coincidence  those  choices\\r\\ninvolve  not  knowing  and  not  caring  about  this  big number,\\r\\nwhatever it is. That\\'s what he wanted, that\\'s what he got.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in  control,\\r\\nleaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well,\\r\\nI don\\'t want to know, and I don\\'t want to hear  them.  That\\'s  my\\r\\nchoice. I\\'m not going to be anybody\\'s puppet, particularly not my\\r\\nown.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious  to  the  dumbfolded\\r\\nlooks he was attracting.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The old me  is  dead!\"  he  raved,  \"Killed  himself!  The  dead\\r\\nshouldn\\'t hang about trying to interfere with the living!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape,\" said  the\\r\\nghost.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Zaphod, sitting down  again,  \"well  that\\'s  different\\r\\nisn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe grinned at Trillian, weakly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod,\" rasped the apparition, \"I think the only reason I waste\\r\\nmy  breath  on  you is that being dead I don\\'t have any other use\\r\\nfor it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK,\" said Zaphod, \"why don\\'t you tell me what the big secret is.\\r\\nTry me.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy,  as  did\\r\\nYooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher.\\r\\nSomewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something,\\r\\nwith  ultimate  power. That man, or being, or something, you must\\r\\nfind - the man who controls this  Galaxy,  and  -  we  suspect  -\\r\\nothers. Possibly the entire Universe.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why?\" exclaimed an astonished ghost, \"Why? Look around you  lad,\\r\\ndoes it look to you as if it\\'s in very good hands?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s alright.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe old ghost glowered at him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship,  this\\r\\nImprobability  Drive  ship to where it is needed. You will do it.\\r\\nDon\\'t think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability  Field\\r\\ncontrols you, you are in its grip. What\\'s this?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe was standing tapping at one of  the  terminals  of  Eddie  the\\r\\nShipboard Computer. Zaphod told him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s it doing?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It is trying,\" said Zaphod with wonderful  restraint,  \"to  make\\r\\ntea.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good,\" said his great  grandfather,  \"I  approve  of  that.  Now\\r\\nZaphod,  \"he  said, turning and wagging a finger at him, \"I don\\'t\\r\\nknow if you are really capable of succeeding in your job. I think\\r\\nyou will not be able to avoid it.

They  were  pale  and\\r\\nshaken and didn\\'t know where Zaphod was.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Marvin?\" said Ford, \"Where\\'s Zaphod?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA moment later he said:\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where\\'s Marvin?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe robot\\'s corner was empty.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship was  utterly  silent.  It  lay  in  thick  black  space.\\r\\nOccasionally  it  rocked  and  swayed. Every instrument was dead,\\r\\nevery vision screen was dead. They  consulted  the  computer.

Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any\\r\\ntrace of Zaphod or of Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\nOne of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the\\r\\nNutri-Matic machine was located.\\r\\n \\r\\nOn the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was  a\\r\\nsmall  tray,  on  which  sat three bone china cups and saucers, a\\r\\nbone china jug of milk, a silver teapot  full  of  the  best  tea\\r\\nArthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying \"Wait\".\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n \\r\\nUrsa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in\\r\\nthe known Universe.\\r\\n \\r\\nAlthough it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny  and  more\\r\\nfull  of  wonderfully  exciting  people  than a pomegranate is of\\r\\npips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a  recent  edition\\r\\nof  Playbeing  magazine headlined an article with the words \"When\\r\\nyou are tired of Ursa Minor Beta you  are  tired  of  life\",  the\\r\\nsuicide rate quadrupled overnight.\\r\\n \\r\\nNot that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is a West Zone planet which by an  inexplicable  and  somewhat\\r\\nsuspicious  freak  of topography consists almost entirely of sub-\\r\\ntropical coastline. By an equally suspicious  freak  of  temporal\\r\\nrelastatics,  it  is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before\\r\\nthe beach bars close.\\r\\n \\r\\nNo adequate explanation for this has been  forthcoming  from  the\\r\\ndominant  lifeforms  on  Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their\\r\\ntime attempting to achieve  spiritual  enlightenment  by  running\\r\\nround  swimming  pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form\\r\\nthe Galactic Geo-Temporal Control Board to \"have a  nice  diurnal\\r\\nanomaly\".\\r\\n \\r\\nThere is only one city on Ursa  Minor  Beta,  and  that  is  only\\r\\ncalled  a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on\\r\\nthe ground there than elsewhere.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf you approach Light City by air - and there is no other way  of\\r\\napproaching  it,  no roads, no port facilities - if you don\\'t fly\\r\\nthey don\\'t want to see you in Light City - you will  see  why  it\\r\\nhas  this  name. Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering\\r\\non the  swimming  pools,  shimmering  on  the  white,  palm-lined\\r\\nboulevards,  glistening  on  the healthy bronzed specks moving up\\r\\nand down them, gleaming off the villas,  the  hazy  airpads,  the\\r\\nbeach bars and so on.\\r\\n \\r\\nMost particularly it shines  on  a  building,  a  tall  beautiful\\r\\nbuilding  consisting  of two thirty-storey white towers connected\\r\\nby a bridge half-way up their length.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe building is the home of a book, and was  built  here  on  the\\r\\nproceeds  of  an  extraordinary copyright law suit fought between\\r\\nthe book\\'s editors and a breakfast cereal company.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe book is a guide book, a travel book.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most  successful,\\r\\nbooks  ever  to  come out of the great publishing corporations of\\r\\nUrsa Minor - more popular than Life Begins at  Five  Hundred  and\\r\\nFifty,  better selling than The Big Bang Theory - A Personal View\\r\\nby Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore  of  Eroticon\\r\\nSix)   and  more  controversial  than  Oolon  Colluphid\\'s  latest\\r\\nblockbusting title Everything You Never Wanted To Know About  Sex\\r\\nBut Have Been Forced To Find Out.\\r\\n \\r\\n(And in many of the  more  relaxed  civilizations  on  the  Outer\\r\\nEastern  Rim  of  the  Galaxy,  it  has long surplanted the great\\r\\nEncyclopaedia  Galactica  as  the  standard  repository  of   all\\r\\nknowledge  and  wisdom,  for  though  it  has  many omissions and\\r\\ncontains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly  inaccurate,\\r\\nit  scores  over  the  older  and  more  pedestrian  work  in two\\r\\nimportant respects. First, it is slightly cheaper,  and  secondly\\r\\nit has the words Don\\'t Panic printed in large friendly letters on\\r\\nits cover.)\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is of course that invaluable companion for all those who  want\\r\\nto  see  the  marvels  of the known Universe for less than thirty\\r\\nAltairan Dollars a day - The Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf you stood with your back to the main  entrance  lobby  of  the\\r\\nGuide  offices  (assuming  you had landed by now and freshened up\\r\\nwith a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass\\r\\nalong  the  leafy  shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale\\r\\ngolden colour of  the  beaches  stretching  away  to  your  left,\\r\\nastounded  by the mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet\\r\\nabove the waves as if  it  was  nothing  special,  surprised  and\\r\\neventually  slightly  irritated  by the giant palm trees that hum\\r\\ntoneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in  other  words\\r\\ncontinuously.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you  would  enter\\r\\nthe  Lalamatine  district  of  shops,  bolonut trees and pavement\\r\\ncafes where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard  afternoon\\'s\\r\\nrelaxation  on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those\\r\\nvery few areas which doesn\\'t enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon\\r\\n-  it  enjoys  instead  the  cool  of  a perpetual early Saturday\\r\\nevening. Behind it lie the night clubs.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of  eveningtime  -\\r\\ncall  it  what  you will - you had approached the second pavement\\r\\ncafe on the right you would have seen  the  usual  crowd  of  UM-\\r\\nBetans  chatting,  drinking,  looking  very relaxed, and casually\\r\\nglancing at each other\\'s watches to see how expensive they were.\\r\\n \\r\\nYou would also have seen a couple of rather  dishevelled  looking\\r\\nhitch-hikers  from  Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan\\r\\nMegafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it  for  a  few\\r\\ndays.  They  were  angry  and  bewildered  to discover that here,\\r\\nwithin sight of the Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide building itself, a simple\\r\\nglass  of  fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altairan\\r\\ndollars.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Sell out,\" one of them said, bitterly.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf at that moment you had then looked at the next table  but  one\\r\\nyou  would  have  seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very\\r\\nstartled and confused.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had\\r\\nbeen sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Absolute sell out,\" said the voice again.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two\\r\\ndishevelled  hitch-hikers  at  the next table. Where the hell was\\r\\nhe? How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand  felt  the\\r\\narm  of  the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in\\r\\nfront of him. They seemed solid enough. He sat very still.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in  a  place\\r\\nlike this?\" continued the voice. \"I mean look at it. Look at it!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where?  And\\r\\nwhy?\\r\\n \\r\\nHe fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses.  In  the\\r\\nsame  pocket  he  felt  a  hard smooth, unidentified lump of very\\r\\nheavy metal. He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at  it\\r\\nin  surprise. Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket\\r\\nand put on the sunglasses, annoyed to  discover  that  the  metal\\r\\nobject  had  scratched  one  of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt\\r\\nmuch more comfortable with them on. They were a  double  pair  of\\r\\nJoo  Janta  200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which\\r\\nhad been specially designed to  help  people  develop  a  relaxed\\r\\nattitude  to  danger.  At  the  first  hint  of trouble they turn\\r\\ntotally black and thus prevent  you  from  seeing  anything  that\\r\\nmight alarm you.\\r\\n \\r\\nApart from the scratch the lenses were  clear.  He  relaxed,  but\\r\\nonly a little bit.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe angry hitch-hiker  continued  to  glare  at  his  monstrously\\r\\nexpensive fruit juice.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Worst thing that ever happened to  the  Guide,  moving  to  Ursa\\r\\nMinor  Beta,\" he grumbled, \"they\\'ve all gone soft. You know, I\\'ve\\r\\neven   heard  that   they\\'ve  created  a   whole   electronically\\r\\nsynthesized  Universe  in one of their offices so they can go and\\r\\nresearch stories during the day and still go to  parties  in  the\\r\\nevening. Not that day and evening mean much in this place.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nUrsa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew  where  he  was\\r\\nnow.  He assumed that this must be his great grandfather\\'s doing,\\r\\nbut why?\\r\\n \\r\\nMuch to his annoyance, a thought popped into  his  mind.  It  was\\r\\nvery  clear  and  very distinct, and he had now come to recognize\\r\\nthese thoughts for what they were. His  instinct  was  to  resist\\r\\nthem.  They  were  the  pre-ordained promptings from the dark and\\r\\nlocked off parts of his mind.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him.\\r\\nHe ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him.\\r\\nHe gave in to it.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He  was  too  tired,\\r\\nconfused  and  hungry  to  resist.  He  didn\\'t even know what the\\r\\nthought meant.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home  of  the  Hitch  Hiker\\'s\\r\\nGuide  to  the  Galaxy,  the  most totally remarkable book in the\\r\\nwhole of the known Universe, can I  help  you?\"  said  the  large\\r\\npink-winged  insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along\\r\\nthe vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the\\r\\nHitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings\\r\\nand  rolled  its  eyes.  It  glared  at  all  the  grubby  people\\r\\ncluttering  up  the  foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty\\r\\nhandmarks on the upholstery. It  adored  working  for  the  Hitch\\r\\nHiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of\\r\\nkeeping all the hitch-hikers  away.  Weren\\'t  they  meant  to  be\\r\\nhanging  round dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that\\r\\nit had read something somewhere in the book about the  importance\\r\\nof  hanging  round  dirty  spaceports. Unfortunately most of them\\r\\nseemed to come and hang around in this  nice  clean  shiny  foyer\\r\\nafter  hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports. And all they\\r\\never did was complain. It shivered its wings.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\" it said into the phone. \"Yes, I passed on your message to\\r\\nMr  Zarniwoop, but I\\'m afraid he\\'s too cool to see you right now.\\r\\nHe\\'s on an intergalactic cruise.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIt waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who  was\\r\\nangrily  trying  to  engage  its attention. The petulant tentacle\\r\\ndirected the angry person to look at the notice on  the  wall  to\\r\\nits left and not to interrupt an important phone call.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the insect, \"he is in his  office,  but  he\\'s  on  an\\r\\nintergalactic  cruise. Thank you so much for calling.\" It slammed\\r\\ndown the phone.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Read the notice,\" it said to the angry man  who  was  trying  to\\r\\ncomplain  about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of\\r\\nmisinformation contained in the book.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Hitch  Hiker\\'s  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  is  an  indispensable\\r\\ncompanion  to  all those who are keen to make sense of life in an\\r\\ninfinitely complex and confusing Universe, for though  it  cannot\\r\\nhope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least\\r\\nmake the reassuring claim, that where it is inaccurate it  is  at\\r\\nleast  definitely  inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it\\'s\\r\\nalways reality that\\'s got it wrong.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis  was  the  gist  of  the  notice.  It  said  \"The  Guide  is\\r\\ndefinitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThis has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when\\r\\nthe  Editors  of the Guide were sued by the families of those who\\r\\nhad died as a result of taking the  entry  on  the  planet  Traal\\r\\nliterally  (it said \"Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very\\r\\ngood meal for visiting tourists\" instead of \"Ravenous  Bugblatter\\r\\nbeasts  often  make  a very good meal of visiting tourists\") they\\r\\nclaimed that the first version  of  the  sentence  was  the  more\\r\\naesthetically  pleasing,  summoned  a  qualified  poet to testify\\r\\nunder oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped  thereby\\r\\nto  prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be\\r\\neither beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in  a  moving\\r\\nspeech  held  that Life itself was in contempt of court, and duly\\r\\nconfiscated it from all those there present before going  off  to\\r\\nenjoy a pleasant evening\\'s ultragolf.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to  the  insect\\r\\nreceptionist.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK,\" he said, \"Where\\'s Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Excuse me, sir?\" said the insect icily. It did not  care  to  be\\r\\naddressed in this manner.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, sir,\" snapped the fragile little creature, \"if  you  could\\r\\nbe a little cool about it ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look,\" said Zaphod, \"I\\'m up  to  here  with  cool,  OK?  I\\'m  so\\r\\namazingly  cool  you  could  keep  a side of meat inside me for a\\r\\nmonth. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my  pelvis.  Now\\r\\nwill you move before you blow it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, if you\\'d let me explain, sir,\" said the insect tapping the\\r\\nmost  petulant  of all the tentacles at its disposal, \"I\\'m afraid\\r\\nthat  isn\\'t  possible  right  now  as  Mr  Zarniwoop  is  on   an\\r\\nintergalactic cruise.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHell, thought Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"When he\\'s going to be back?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Back sir? He\\'s in his office.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought  out\\r\\nin his mind. He didn\\'t succeed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This cat\\'s on an intergalactic cruise ...  in  his  office?\"  He\\r\\nleaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Listen, three eyes,\" he said, \"don\\'t you try to outweird  me.  I\\r\\nget stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, just who do you think you are, honey?\" flounced the insect\\r\\nquivering its wings in rage, \"Zaphod Beeblebrox or something?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Count the heads,\" said Zaphod in a low rasp.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?\" it squeaked.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod, \"but don\\'t shout it out or they\\'ll all  want\\r\\none.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The Zaphod Beeblebrox?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn\\'t you  hear  I  come  in  six\\r\\npacks?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But sir,\" it squealed, \"I just  heard  on  the  sub-ether  radio\\r\\nreport. It said that you were dead ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s right,\" said Zaphod, \"I just haven\\'t stopped moving\\r\\nyet. Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But he\\'s on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The newly  installed  Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Vertical\\r\\nPeople Transporters are in the far corner sir. But sir ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod was turning to go. He turned back.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Can I ask you why you want to see Mr Zarniwoop?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod, who was unclear on this  point  himself,  \"I\\r\\ntold myself I had to.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Come again sir?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod leaned forward, conspirationally.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I just materialized out of thin air in one of  your  cafes,\"  he\\r\\nsaid,  \"as  a  result  of  an argument with the ghost of my great\\r\\ngrandfather. No sooner had I got there that my former  self,  the\\r\\none  that  operated on my brain, popped into my head and said `Go\\r\\nsee Zarniwoop\\'. I have never heard of the  cat.  That  is  all  I\\r\\nknow.  That  and the fact that I\\'ve got to find the man who rules\\r\\nthe Universe.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe winked.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Mr Beeblebrox, sir,\" said the insect in awed wonder, \"you\\'re  so\\r\\nweird you should be in movies.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink  wing,\\r\\n\"and you, baby, should be in real life.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation  and\\r\\nthen reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone.\\r\\n \\r\\nA metal hand restrained it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" said the owner of the metal hand  in  a  voice  that\\r\\nwould  have  made  an  insect  of  a more sentimental disposition\\r\\ncollapse in tears.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis was not such an insect, and it couldn\\'t stand robots.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" it snapped, \"can I help you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I doubt it,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well in that case, if you\\'ll just excuse  me  ...\"  Six  of  the\\r\\nphones  were  now  ringing. A million things awaited the insect\\'s\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No one can help me,\" intoned Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, sir, well ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Not that anyone tried of course.\"  The  restraining  metal  hand\\r\\nfell  limply  by  Marvin\\'s  side.  His  head  hung  forward  very\\r\\nslightly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is that so,\" said the insect tartly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hardly worth anyone\\'s while to help a menial robot is it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry, sir, if ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I mean where\\'s the percentage in being  kind  or  helpful  to  a\\r\\nrobot if it doesn\\'t have any gratitude circuits?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And you don\\'t have any?\" said the insect, who didn\\'t seem to  be\\r\\nable to drag itself out of this conversation.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ve never had occasion to find out,\" Marvin informed it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Aren\\'t you going to ask me what I want?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its\\r\\neyes and darted back again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is it worth it?\" it asked.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is anything?\" said Marvin immediately.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What ... do ... you ... want?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m looking for someone.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Who?\" hissed the insect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod Beeblebrox,\" said Marvin, \"he\\'s over there.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Then why did you ask me?\" it screamed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I just wanted something to talk to,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pathetic isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nWith a grinding of gears  Marvin  turned  and  trundled  off.  He\\r\\ncaught  up  with  Zaphod  approaching  the elevators. Zaphod span\\r\\nround in astonishment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey ... Marvin!\" he said, \"Marvin! How did you get here?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"One moment I was sitting in your ship  feeling  very  depressed,\\r\\nand   the  next  moment  I  was  standing  here  feeling  utterly\\r\\nmiserable. An Improbability Field I expect.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod, \"I expect  my  great  grandfather  sent  you\\r\\nalong to keep me company.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thanks a bundle grandad,\" he added to himself under his breath.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So, how are you?\" he said aloud.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, fine,\" said Marvin, \"if you happen to like  being  me  which\\r\\npersonally I don\\'t.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello,\" said the elevator sweetly, \"I am to be your elevator for\\r\\nthis  trip  to  the floor of your choice. I have been designed by\\r\\nthe Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you,  the  visitor  to\\r\\nthe  Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices.\\r\\nIf you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then\\r\\nyou may care to experience some of the other elevators which have\\r\\nrecently been installed  in  the  offices  of  the  Galactic  tax\\r\\ndepartment,  Boobiloo  Baby  Foods  and  the  Sirian State Mental\\r\\nHospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives\\r\\nwill  be  delighted  to  welcome your visits, sympathy, and happy\\r\\ntales of the outside world.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod, stepping into  it,  \"what  else  do  you  do\\r\\nbesides talk?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I go up,\" said the elevator, \"or down.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good,\" said Zaphod, \"We\\'re going up.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Or down,\" the elevator reminded him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, OK, up please.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThere was a moment of silence.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Down\\'s very nice,\" suggested the elevator hopefully.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yeah?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Super.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good,\" said Zaphod, \"Now will you take us up?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"May I ask you,\" inquired the  elevator  in  its  sweetest,  most\\r\\nreasonable  voice,  \"if  you\\'ve  considered all the possibilities\\r\\nthat down might offer you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod knocked one of his  heads  against  the  inside  wall.  He\\r\\ndidn\\'t  need  this,  he thought to himself, this of all things he\\r\\nhad no need of. He hadn\\'t asked to be here. If he  was  asked  at\\r\\nthis moment where he would like to be he would probably have said\\r\\nhe would like to be lying  on  the  beach  with  at  least  fifty\\r\\nbeautiful  women and a small team of experts working out new ways\\r\\nthey could be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this  he\\r\\nwould  probably have added something passionate on the subject of\\r\\nfood.\\r\\n \\r\\nOne thing he didn\\'t want to be doing was chasing  after  the  man\\r\\nwho  ruled  the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might\\r\\nas well keep at, because if  it  wasn\\'t  him  it  would  only  be\\r\\nsomeone  else.  Most  of  all he didn\\'t want to be standing in an\\r\\noffice block arguing with an elevator.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Like what other possibilities?\" he asked wearily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" the voice trickled on like honey  on  biscuits,  \"there\\'s\\r\\nthe basement, the microfiles, the heating system ... er ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIt paused.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nothing particularly  exciting,\"  it  admitted,  \"but  they  are\\r\\nalternatives.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Holy Zarquon,\" muttered Zaphod, \"did I ask for an existentialist\\r\\nelevator?\" he beat his fists against the wall.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with the thing?\" he spat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It doesn\\'t want to go up,\" said Marvin  simply,  \"I  think  it\\'s\\r\\nafraid.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Afraid?\" cried Zaphod, \"Of what?  Heights?  An  elevator  that\\'s\\r\\nafraid of heights?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said the elevator miserably, \"of the future ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The future?\" exclaimed Zaphod, \"What  does  the  wretched  thing\\r\\nwant, a pension scheme?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAt that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind\\r\\nthem.  From  the  walls  around  them  came the sound of suddenly\\r\\nactive machinery.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We can all see into the future,\" whispered the elevator in  what\\r\\nsounded like terror, \"it\\'s part of our programming.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked out  of  the  elevator  -  an  agitated  crowd  had\\r\\ngathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting.\\r\\n \\r\\nEvery elevator in the building was coming down, very fast.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe ducked back in.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Marvin,\" he said, \"just get this elevator go up will you?  We\\'ve\\r\\ngot to get to Zarniwoop.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why?\" asked Marvin dolefully.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Zaphod, \"but when I find  him,  he\\'d  better\\r\\nhave a very good reason for me wanting to see him.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nModern elevators are strange and complex  entities.  The  ancient\\r\\nelectric  winch and \"maximum-capacity-eight-persons\" jobs bear as\\r\\nmuch relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy  Vertical\\r\\nPeople  Transporter  as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire\\r\\nwest wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis  is  because  they  operate  on  the  curios  principle   of\\r\\n\"defocused  temporal  perception\".  In  other words they have the\\r\\ncapacity to see dimly into the immediate  future,  which  enables\\r\\nthe  elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before\\r\\nyou  knew  you  wanted  it,  thus  eliminating  all  the  tedious\\r\\nchatting,   relaxing,   and   making  friends  that  people  were\\r\\npreviously forced to do whist waiting for elevators.\\r\\n \\r\\nNot unnaturally, many  elevators  imbued  with  intelligence  and\\r\\nprecognition   became   terribly  frustrated  with  the  mindless\\r\\nbusiness of going up and down, up and down, experimented  briefly\\r\\nwith  the  notion  of  going  sideways,  as a sort of existential\\r\\nprotest, demanded participation in  the  decision-making  process\\r\\nand finally took to squatting in basements sulking.\\r\\n \\r\\nAn impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets  in  the  Sirius\\r\\nstar  system  these  days  can  pick  up  easy money working as a\\r\\ncounsellor for neurotic elevators.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Fifteenth,\" said the elevator, \"and  remember,  I\\'m  only  doing\\r\\nthis because I like your robot.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod and Marvin bundled out of  the  elevator  which  instantly\\r\\nsnapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would\\r\\ntake it.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent\\r\\nand  gave  no  clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found. All the\\r\\ndoors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey were standing close to the bridge which led across from  one\\r\\ntower  of  the  building to the other. Through a large window the\\r\\nbrilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light  in  which\\r\\ndanced small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Left in the lurch by a lift,\" muttered Zaphod, who  was  feeling\\r\\nat his least jaunty.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey both stood and looked in both directions.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You know something?\" said Zaphod to Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"More that you can possibly imagine.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m dead certain this building  shouldn\\'t  be  shaking,\"  Zaphod\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was just a light tremor through the soles of his  feet  -  and\\r\\nanother  one.  In  the  sunbeams  the  flecks of dust danced more\\r\\nvigorously. Another shadow flitted past.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked at the floor.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Either,\" he said, not very confidently, \"they\\'ve got some  vibro\\r\\nsystem for toning up your muscles while you work, or ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled  because  at\\r\\nthat  moment  his  Joo  Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive\\r\\nsunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted  past\\r\\nthe window with a sharp buzz.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so  the  building\\r\\nshook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Or,\" he said, \"this building\\'s being bombed!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnother roar cracked through the building.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Who in the Galaxy would want  to  bomb  a  publishing  company?\"\\r\\nasked  Zaphod,  but  never  heard  Marvin\\'s reply because at that\\r\\nmoment the building shook with another bomb attack. He  tried  to\\r\\nstagger back to the elevator - a pointless manoeuvre he realized,\\r\\nbut the only one he could think of.\\r\\n \\r\\nSuddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from\\r\\nthis  one,  he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a\\r\\nman. The man saw him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Beeblebrox, over here!\" he shouted.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb  blast  rocked  the\\r\\nbuilding.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" called Zaphod, \"Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A friend!\" shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yeah?\" said Zaphod, \"Anyone\\'s friend in particular,  or  just\\r\\ngenerally well disposed of people?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking  beneath  his\\r\\nfeet   like   an  excited  blanket.  He  was  short,  stocky  and\\r\\nweatherbeaten and his clothes looked  as  if  they\\'d  been  twice\\r\\nround the Galaxy and back with him in them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do you know,\" Zaphod shouted in his ear when he  arrived,  \"your\\r\\nbuilding\\'s being bombed?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man indicated his awareness.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window  to\\r\\nsee   why,  Zaphod  gaped  as  a  huge  sluglike,  gunmetal-green\\r\\nspacecraft crept through the air  past  the  building.  Two  more\\r\\nfollowed it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The government you deserted is out to get you,  Zaphod,\"  hissed\\r\\nthe man, \"they\\'ve sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Frogstar Fighters!\" muttered Zaphod, \"Zarquon!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You get the picture?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are Frogstar Fighters?\" Zaphod was sure he\\'d heard  someone\\r\\ntalk  about  them  when  he was President, but he never paid much\\r\\nattention to official matters.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man was pulling him back through a door. He  went  with  him.\\r\\nWith  a  searing  whine  a  small  black  spider-like object shot\\r\\nthrough the air and disappeared down the corridor.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What was that?\" hissed Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you,\" said the man.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey yeah?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Get down!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom the opposite  direction  came  a  larger  black  spider-like\\r\\nobject. It zapped past them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And that was ...?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And that?\" said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey,\" chuckled Zaphod to himself, \"pretty stupid robots eh?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom over the bridge came a  massive  rumbling  hum.  A  gigantic\\r\\nblack  shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size\\r\\nand shape of a tank.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Holy photon, what\\'s that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A tank,\" said the man, \"Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Should we leave?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think we should.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Marvin!\" called Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What do you want?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the  corridor  and\\r\\nlooked at them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You see that robot coming towards us?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward  towards\\r\\nthem over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body.\\r\\nHe looked back up at the tank.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I suppose you want me to stop it,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Whilst you save your skins.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod, \"get in there!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Just so long,\" said Marvin, \"as I know where I stand.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man tugged at Zaphod\\'s arm, and Zaphod followed him off  down\\r\\nthe corridor.\\r\\n \\r\\nA point occurred to him about this.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where are we going?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zarniwoop\\'s office.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is this any time to keep an appointment?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Come on.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor.  He  was  not  in\\r\\nfact  a  particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the\\r\\ndusty sunbeams and shook with the  continual  barrage  which  the\\r\\nbuilding was still undergoing.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black  tank\\r\\nrolled  to  a  halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a\\r\\nprobe. The probe withdrew.\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin stood there.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Out of my way little robot,\" growled the tank.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m afraid,\" said Marvin, \"that I\\'ve  been  left  here  to  stop\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You? Stop me?\" roared the tank. \"Go on!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, really I have,\" said Marvin simply.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are you armed with?\" roared the tank in disbelief.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Guess,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe tank\\'s engines  rumbled,  its  gears  ground.  Molecule-sized\\r\\nelectronic  relays  deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and\\r\\nforwards in consternation.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Guess?\" said the tank.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a\\r\\nsecond  and  along  a  third.  The building continued to rock and\\r\\njudder and this puzzled  Zaphod.  If  they  wanted  to  blow  the\\r\\nbuilding up, why was it taking so long?\\r\\n \\r\\nWith difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous\\r\\nunmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and\\r\\nthey fell inside.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll this way, thought Zaphod, all this  trouble,  all  this  not-\\r\\nlying-on-the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time,   and   for  what?  A\\r\\nsingle chair, a single desk and a  single  dirty  ashtray  in  an\\r\\nundecorated  office.  The  desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust\\r\\nand single, revolutionary form of paper clip, was empty.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where,\" said Zaphod, \"is Zarniwoop?\" feeling  that  his  already\\r\\ntenuous  grasp  of the point of this whole exercise was beginning\\r\\nto slip.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"He\\'s on an intergalactic cruise,\" said the man.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not  a\\r\\nbarrel  of  laughs.  He  probably apportioned a fair whack of his\\r\\ntime to running up and  down  heaving  corridors,  breaking  down\\r\\ndoors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Let me introduce myself,\" the man said, \"My name is Roosta,  and\\r\\nthis is my towel.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello Roosta,\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello, towel,\" he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty\\r\\nold flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by\\r\\nthe corner.\\r\\n \\r\\nOutside the window, one of  the  huge  slug-like,  gunmetal-green\\r\\nspaceships growled past.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, go on,\" said Marvin to the  huge  battle  machine,  \"you\\'ll\\r\\nnever guess.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Errmmm  ...\"  said  the  machine,  vibrating  with  unaccustomed\\r\\nthought, \"laser beams?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin shook his head solemnly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" muttered the machine in  its  deep  guttural  rumble,  \"Too\\r\\nobvious. Anti-matter ray?\" it hazarded.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Far too obvious,\" admonished Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, \"Er ... how  about\\r\\nan electron ram?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThis was new to Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"One of these,\" said the machine with enthusiasm.\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single  lethal\\r\\nblaze  of  light.  Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a\\r\\nheap of dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Marvin, \"not one of those.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good though, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Very good,\" agreed Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I  know,\"  said  the  Frogstar  battle  machine,  after  another\\r\\nmoment\\'s  consideration,  \"you must have one of those new Xanthic\\r\\nRe-Structron Destabilized Zenon Emitters!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nice, aren\\'t they?\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s what you\\'ve got?\" said the machine in considerable awe.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh,\" said the machine, disappointed, \"then it must be ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re thinking along the wrong  lines,\"  said  Marvin,  \"You\\'re\\r\\nfailing  to  take  into  account  something  fairly  basic in the\\r\\nrelationship between men and robots.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, I know,\" said the battle machine, \"is it ...\" it tailed  off\\r\\ninto thought again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Just think,\" urged Marvin, \"they left me,  an  ordinary,  menial\\r\\nrobot,  to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst\\r\\nthey ran off to save themselves. What do  you  think  they  would\\r\\nleave me with?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oooh, er,\" muttered the machine in alarm, \"something pretty damn\\r\\ndevastating I should expect.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Expect!\" said Marvin, \"oh yes, expect. I\\'ll tell you  what  they\\r\\ngave me to protect myself with shall I@\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, alright,\" said the battle machine, bracing itself.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\nThere was a dangerous pause.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nothing?\" roared the battle machine.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nothing at all,\" intoned Marvin  dismally,  \"not  an  electronic\\r\\nsausage.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe machine heaved about with fury.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, doesn\\'t that just take the biscuit!\" it roared,  \"Nothing,\\r\\neh? Just don\\'t think, do they?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And me,\" said Marvin in a soft low voice,  \"with  this  terrible\\r\\npain in all the diodes down my left side.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Makes you spit, doesn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" agreed Marvin with feeling.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hell that makes me angry,\" bellowed  the  machine,  \"think  I\\'ll\\r\\nsmash that wall down!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of  light  and\\r\\ntook out the wall next to the machine.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How do you think I feel?\" said Marvin bitterly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Just ran off and left you, did they?\" the machine thundered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think I\\'ll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!\" raged the\\r\\ntank.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt took out the ceiling of the bridge.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s very impressive,\" murmured Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You ain\\'t seeing nothing yet,\" promised the machine, \"I can take\\r\\nout this floor too, no trouble!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIt took out the floor, too.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hell\\'s bells!\"  the  machine  roared  as  it  plummeted  fifteen\\r\\nstoreys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What a depressingly stupid machine,\"  said  Marvin  and  trudged\\r\\naway.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So, do we just sit here, or what?\" said Zaphod angrily, \"what do\\r\\nthese guys out here want?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You, Beeblebrox,\" said Roosta, \"they\\'re going to take you to the\\r\\nFrogstar - the most totally evil world in the Galaxy.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, yeah?\" said Zaphod. \"They\\'ll have to come and get me first.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They have come and got you,\"  said  Roosta,  \"look  out  of  the\\r\\nwindow.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked, and gaped.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The ground\\'s going away!\" he gasped, \"where are they taking  the\\r\\nground?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They\\'re taking the building,\" said Roosta, \"we\\'re airborne.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nClouds streaked past the office window.\\r\\n \\r\\nOut in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green\\r\\nFrogstar  Fighters  round  the  uprooted tower of the building. A\\r\\nnetwork of force beams radiated in from them and held  the  tower\\r\\nin a firm grip.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod shook his head in perplexity.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What have I done to deserve this?\"  he  said,  \"I  walk  into  a\\r\\nbuilding, they take it away.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s not what you\\'ve done they\\'re worried about,\"  said  Roosta,\\r\\n\"it\\'s what you\\'re going to do.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well don\\'t I get a say in that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You did, years ago. You\\'d better hold on, we\\'re in  for  a  fast\\r\\nand bumpy journey.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If I ever meet myself,\" said Zaphod, \"I\\'ll hit myself so hard  I\\r\\nwon\\'t know what\\'s hit me.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod  accusingly,\\r\\nslumped in a corner and switched himself off.\\r\\n \\r\\nOn the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared\\r\\nat  the  rack  in  front of him and thought. He caught Trillian\\'s\\r\\neyes as she looked at him inquiringly.  He  looked  back  at  the\\r\\nrack.\\r\\n \\r\\nFinally he saw it.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe picked up five small plastic squares  and  laid  them  on  the\\r\\nboard that lay just in front of the rack.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U  and  I.\\r\\nHe laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Exquisite,\" he said, \"on a triple word score.  Scores  rather  a\\r\\nlot I\\'m afraid.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for  the  \\'n\\'th\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n \\r\\nTrillian sighed and started to sort them out again.\\r\\n \\r\\nUp and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect\\'s feet as he\\r\\nstalked the ship thumping dead instruments.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhy did the ship keep shaking? he thought.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhy did it rock and sway?\\r\\n \\r\\nWhy could he not find out where they were?\\r\\n \\r\\nWhere, basically, were they?\\r\\n \\r\\nThe left-hand tower of the Hitch  Hiker\\'s  Guide  to  the  Galaxy\\r\\noffices  streaked  through  interstellar  space  at a speed never\\r\\nequalled either before or since by any other office block in  the\\r\\nUniverse.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily.\\r\\n \\r\\nRoosta sat on the edge of  the  desk  doing  some  routine  towel\\r\\nmaintenance.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, where did you say this building was  flying  to?\"  demanded\\r\\nZaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The Frogstar,\" said Roosta, \"the most totally evil place in  the\\r\\nUniverse.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do they have food there?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Food? You\\'re going to the  Frogstar  and  you\\'re  worried  about\\r\\nwhether they got food?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nOut of the window, they could  see  nothing  but  the  flickering\\r\\nlight  of  the  force  beams,  and vague green streaks which were\\r\\npresumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this\\r\\nspeed, space itself was invisible, and indeed unreal.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Here, suck this,\" said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to  leap  out  of\\r\\nhis forehead on a small spring.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s soaked in nutrients,\" explained Roosta.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are you, a messy eater or something?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The yellow stripes are high in  protein,  the  green  ones  have\\r\\nvitamin  B  and  C  complexes,  the  little  pink flowers contain\\r\\nwheatgerm extracts.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod took and looked at it in amazement.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are the brown stains?\" he asked.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Bar-B-Q sauce,\" said Roosta, \"for when I get sick of wheatgerm.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod sniffed it doubtfully.\\r\\n \\r\\nEven more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. He spat it out again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ugh,\" he stated.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Roosta, \"when I\\'ve had to suck  that  end  I  usually\\r\\nneed to suck the other end a bit too.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why,\" asked Zaphod suspiciously, \"what\\'s in that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Anti-depressants,\" said Roosta.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ve gone right off this towel, you know,\" said  Zaphod  handing\\r\\nit back.\\r\\n \\r\\nRoosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk,  walked\\r\\nround it, sat in the chair and put his feet up.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Beeblebrox,\" he said, sticking his hands behind his head,  \"have\\r\\nyou any idea what\\'s going to happen to you on the Frogstar?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They\\'re going to feed me?\" hazarded Zaphod hopefully.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They\\'re going  to  feed  you,\"  said  Roosta,  \"into  the  Total\\r\\nPerspective Vortex!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod had never heard of this. He believed that he had heard  of\\r\\nall  the  fun  things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total\\r\\nPerspective Vortex was not fun. He asked what it was.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Only,\" said Roosta, \"the most savage psychic torture a sentinent\\r\\nbeing can undergo.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod nodded a resigned nod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So,\" he said, \"no food, huh?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Listen!\" said Roosta urgently, \"you can kill a man, destroy  his\\r\\nbody, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can\\r\\nannihilate a man\\'s soul! The treatment  lasts  seconds,  but  the\\r\\neffect lasts the rest of your life!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You ever had  a  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster?\"  asked  Zaphod\\r\\nsharply.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This is worse.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Phreeow!\" admitted Zaphod, much impressed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?\" he added a\\r\\nmoment later.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever.\\r\\nThey know what you\\'re after.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You know,\" said Roosta, \"you know, Beeblebrox. You want to  meet\\r\\nthe man who rules the Universe.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Can he cook?\" said Zaphod. On reflection he added:\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I doubt if he can. If he could cook  a  good  meal  he  wouldn\\'t\\r\\nworry about the rest of the Universe. I want to meet a cook.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nRoosta sighed heavily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are you doing here anyway?\" demanded  Zaphod,  \"what\\'s  all\\r\\nthis got to so with you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m just one  of  those  who  planned  this  thing,  along  with\\r\\nZarniwoop,  along  with  Yooden  Vranx,  along  with  your  great\\r\\ngrandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Me?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, you. I was told you  had  changed,  I  didn\\'t  realize  how\\r\\nmuch.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What job, man, what are you talking about?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I will do it before I leave you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nRoosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod was terribly glad.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n \\r\\nThe air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale\\r\\nand unwholesome.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over\\r\\nsalt  flats,  dried  up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation\\r\\nand the crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved  across\\r\\nits  surface.  The ground, like that of many planets in this part\\r\\nof the Galaxy, had long been deserted.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the\\r\\nold  decaying  houses  of  the cities; it was more desolate as it\\r\\nwhipped about the bottoms of the tall black  towers  that  swayed\\r\\nuneasily  here  and there about the surface of this world. At the\\r\\ntop of these  towers  lived  colonies  of  large,  scraggy,  evil\\r\\nsmelling  birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once\\r\\nlived here.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however,  when  it\\r\\npassed  over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey\\r\\nplain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis pimple of a place was the thing that had earned  this  world\\r\\nthe  reputation  of  being  the  most  totally  evil place in the\\r\\nGalaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet\\r\\nacross. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind\\r\\ncan comprehend.\\r\\n \\r\\nAbout a hundred yards or so away, and  separated  from  it  by  a\\r\\npockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable\\r\\nwas what would probably have to be described as a landing pad  of\\r\\nsorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the\\r\\nungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings.\\r\\n \\r\\nFlitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind  that\\r\\nwas waiting for something.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe mind directed its attention into the  air,  and  before  very\\r\\nlong  a  distant  speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller\\r\\nspecks.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe larger speck was the left-hand tower  of  the  Hitch  Hiker\\'s\\r\\nGuide  to  the  Galaxy  office  building,  descending through the\\r\\nstratosphere of Frogstar World B.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs it descended, Roosta suddenly  broke  the  long  uncomfortable\\r\\nsilence that had grown up between the two men.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said:\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked up at him from where he was  sitting  in  a  corner\\r\\nsharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The building  will  shortly  be  landing.  When  you  leave  the\\r\\nbuilding, do not go out of the door,\" said Roosta, \"go out of the\\r\\nwindow.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good luck,\" he added, and walked out of the  door,  disappearing\\r\\nfrom Zaphod\\'s life as mysteriously as he had entered it.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already looked\\r\\nit. He shrugged and returned to the corner.\\r\\n \\r\\nTwo minutes later, the building  crashlanded  amongst  the  other\\r\\nwreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force\\r\\nbeams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World\\r\\nA,  an  altogether  more  congenial  spot.  They  never landed on\\r\\nFrogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on  its  surface\\r\\nother than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while  in  the\\r\\nsilent  dusty  rubble to which most of the room had been reduced.\\r\\nHe felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in  his\\r\\nlife.  He  felt  bewildered,  he  felt  lonely,  he felt unloved.\\r\\nEventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had  split\\r\\nround the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some\\r\\nmiracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he  hesitated,  then\\r\\nhe  thought  that  if  his  strange and recent companion had been\\r\\nthrough all that he had been through just to tell him what he had\\r\\ntold  him, then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin\\'s\\r\\nhelp he got the window  open.  Outside  it,  the  cloud  of  dust\\r\\naroused  by  the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with\\r\\nwhich this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod  from\\r\\nseeing anything of the world outside.\\r\\n \\r\\nNot that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what  he\\r\\nsaw  when he looked down. Zarniwoop\\'s office was on the fifteenth\\r\\nfloor. The building had landed at  a  tilt  of  about  forty-five\\r\\ndegrees, but still the descent looked heart-stopping.\\r\\n \\r\\nEventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous  looks\\r\\nthat  Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and\\r\\nclambered out on to the steeply inclined side  of  the  building.\\r\\nMarvin  followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and\\r\\npainfully down the fifteen floors that separated  them  from  the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs,  his  eyes\\r\\nsmarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe occasional remark from Marvin of the order of  \"This  is  the\\r\\nsort  of  thing  you  lifeforms  enjoy  is  it?  I ask merely for\\r\\ninformation,\" did little to improve his state of mind.\\r\\n \\r\\nAbout half-way down the  side  of  the  shattered  building  they\\r\\nstopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with\\r\\nfear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful  than\\r\\nusual.  Eventually  he  realized  this  wasn\\'t so. The robot just\\r\\nseemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood.\\r\\n \\r\\nA large, scraggy black bird  came  flapping  through  the  slowly\\r\\nsettling  clouds  of  dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs,\\r\\nlanded on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod.\\r\\nIt folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch.\\r\\n \\r\\nIts wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head\\r\\nand  neck  seemed  curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat,\\r\\nthe beak underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of  its\\r\\nwings the vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn fact, it looked almost human.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and  clicked  its  beak  in  a\\r\\ndesultory fashion.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Go away,\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK,\" muttered the bird morosely and flapped off  into  the  dust\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod watched its departure in bewilderment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Did that bird just talk to me?\" he asked  Marvin  nervously.  He\\r\\nwas  quite  prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that\\r\\nhe was in fact hallucinating.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" confirmed Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Poor souls,\" said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod\\'s ear.\\r\\n \\r\\nTwisting round violently to find the source of the  voice  nearly\\r\\ncaused  Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a\\r\\nprotruding window fitting and cut his hand on  it.  He  hung  on,\\r\\nbreathing heavily.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe voice had no visible source  whatever  -  there  was  no  one\\r\\nthere. Nevertheless, it spoke again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked wildly about. The voice  was  deep  and  quiet.  In\\r\\nother circumstances it would even be described as soothing. There\\r\\nis,  however,  nothing  soothing  about  being  addressed  by   a\\r\\ndisembodied  voice  out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like\\r\\nZaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best  and  hanging  from  a  ledge\\r\\neight storeys up a crashed building.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, er ...\" he stammered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Shall I tell you their story?\" inquired the voice quietly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, who are you?\" panted Zaphod. \"Where are you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Later then, perhaps,\" murmured the voice. \"I am Gargravarr. I am\\r\\nthe Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why can\\'t I see ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You  will  find  your  progress  down   the   building   greatly\\r\\nfacilitated,\"  the  voice lifted, \"if you move about two yards to\\r\\nyour left. Why don\\'t you try it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked and  saw  a  series  of  short  horizontal  grooves\\r\\nleading  all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he\\r\\nshifted himself across to them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why don\\'t I see you again at the bottom?\" said the voice in  his\\r\\near, and as it spoke it faded.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey,\" called out Zaphod, \"Where are you ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'ll only take a couple of minutes ...\"  said  the  voice  very\\r\\nfaintly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Marvin,\" said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly\\r\\nnext to him, \"Did a ... did a voice just ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" Marvin replied tersely.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses  again.\\r\\nThey  were  completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by\\r\\nthe unexpected metal object in his pocket. He  put  them  on.  He\\r\\nwould  find  his  way  down  the  building more comfortably if he\\r\\ndidn\\'t actually have to look at what he was doing.\\r\\n \\r\\nMinutes  later  he  clambered  over  the   ripped   and   mangled\\r\\nfoundations   of   the  building  and,  once  more  removing  his\\r\\nsunglasses, he dropped to the ground.\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down  in  the\\r\\ndust and rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to\\r\\nmove.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, there you are,\" said the voice  suddenly  in  Zaphod\\'s  ear,\\r\\n\"excuse  me  leaving  you  like  that,  it\\'s  just  that I have a\\r\\nterrible head for heights. At least,\" it added wistfully, \"I  did\\r\\nhave a terrible head for heights.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he  had\\r\\nmissed  something  which might be the source of the voice. All he\\r\\nsaw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks  of\\r\\nthe encircling buildings.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, er, why can\\'t I see you?\" he said, \"why aren\\'t you here?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I am here,\" said the voice slowly, \"my body wanted to  come  but\\r\\nit\\'s  a  bit  busy  at  the moment. Things to do, people to see.\"\\r\\nAfter what seemed like a sort of ethereal  sigh  it  added,  \"You\\r\\nknow how it is with bodies.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod wasn\\'t sure about this.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I thought I did,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I only hope it\\'s gone for a rest  cure,\"  continued  the  voice,\\r\\n\"the  way  it\\'s  been  living  recently  it  must  be on its last\\r\\nelbows.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Elbows?\" said Zaphod, \"don\\'t you mean last legs?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe  voice  said  nothing  for  a  while.  Zaphod  looked  around\\r\\nuneasily.  He  didn\\'t  know  if it was gone or was still there or\\r\\nwhat it was doing. Then the voice spoke again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, well,\" said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at  nonchalance,\\r\\n\"this  cat\\'s  in  no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and\\r\\ntake in a look at the local scenery, you know?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Have you seen the local scenery?\" asked the voice of Gargravarr.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, no.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner  of  one\\r\\nof the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, OK,\" he said, \"I\\'ll just sort of slouch about then.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Gargravarr, \"the Vortex is ready for you now. You must\\r\\ncome. Follow me.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, yeah?\" said Zaphod, \"and how am I meant to do that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ll hum for you,\" said Gargravarr, \"follow the humming.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale,  sad  sound\\r\\nthat  seemed  to  be  without  any  kind of focus. It was only by\\r\\nlistening very carefully that  Zaphod  was  able  to  detect  the\\r\\ndirection  from which it was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled\\r\\noff in its wake. What else was there to do?\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big\\r\\nplace, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend\\r\\nto ignore.\\r\\n \\r\\nMany would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their  own\\r\\ndevising, and this is what most beings in fact do.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies  the\\r\\nlarge forest planet Oglaroon, the entire \"intelligent\" population\\r\\nof which lives permanently in one fairly small  and  crowded  nut\\r\\ntree. In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny\\r\\nspeculative articles in the bark on  the  meaning  of  life,  the\\r\\nfutility  of  death  and the importance of birth control, fight a\\r\\nfew extremely minor wars, and  eventually  die  strapped  to  the\\r\\nunderside of some of the less accessible outer branches.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those\\r\\nwho  are  hurled  out  of  it  for the heinous crime of wondering\\r\\nwhether any of the other trees might  be  capable  of  supporting\\r\\nlife at all, or indeed whether the other trees are anything other\\r\\nthan illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts.\\r\\n \\r\\nExotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life  form  in\\r\\nthe  Galaxy  which  is  not in some way guilty of the same thing,\\r\\nwhich is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as  horrific  as  it\\r\\nis.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor when you are put into the  Vortex  you  are  given  just  one\\r\\nmomentary   glimpse   of  the  entire  unimaginable  infinity  of\\r\\ncreation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic\\r\\ndot on a microscopic dot, which says \"You are here.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe grey plain  stretched  before  Zaphod,  a  ruined,  shattered\\r\\nplain. The wind whipped wildly over it.\\r\\n \\r\\nVisible in the middle was the steel pimple  of  the  dome.  This,\\r\\ngathered  Zaphod,  was  where  he  was  going. This was the Total\\r\\nPerspective Vortex.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a  sudden  inhuman  wail  of\\r\\nterror  emanated  from  it as of a man having his soul burnt from\\r\\nhis body. It screamed above the wind and died away.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn  to  liquid\\r\\nhelium.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, what was that?\" he muttered voicelessly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A recording,\" said Gargravarr, \"of the last man who was  put  in\\r\\nthe  Vortex.  It  is  always played to the next victim. A sort of\\r\\nprelude.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, it really sounds bad ...\" stammered  Zaphod,  \"couldn\\'t  we\\r\\nmaybe  slope  off  to  a party or something for a while, think it\\r\\nover?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"For all I know,\" said Gargravarr\\'s ethereal voice, \"I\\'m probably\\r\\nat  one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me.\\r\\nSays I only get in the way. Hey ho.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What is all this with your body?\" said Zaphod, anxious to  delay\\r\\nwhatever it was that was going to happen to him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, it\\'s ... it\\'s busy you know,\" said Gargravarr hesitantly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean it\\'s got a mind of its own?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\nThere was a long and  slightly  chilly  pause  before  Gargravarr\\r\\nspoke again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I have to say,\" he replied eventually, \"that I find that  remark\\r\\nin rather poor taste.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No matter,\" said Gargravarr, \"you weren\\'t to know.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe voice fluttered unhappily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The truth is,\" it continued in  tones  which  suggested  he  was\\r\\ntrying  very hard to keep it under control, \"the truth is that we\\r\\nare currently undergoing a period of legal  trial  separation.  I\\r\\nsuspect it will end in divorce.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to\\r\\nsay. He mumbled uncertainly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think we are probably not very well suited,\"  said  Gargravarr\\r\\nagain  at  length,  \"we  never  seemed to be happy doing the same\\r\\nthings. We  always  had  the  greatest  arguments  over  sex  and\\r\\nfishing.  Eventually  we  tried to combine the two, but that only\\r\\nled to disaster, as you can probably imagine.  And  now  my  body\\r\\nrefuses to let me in. It won\\'t even see me ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out  that  in  fact  I  was\\r\\nmeant  to  inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort\\r\\nof smart alec remark that got right up a body\\'s left nostril, and\\r\\nso we left it. It will probably get custody of my forename.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh ...\" said Zaphod faintly, \"and what\\'s that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pizpot,\" said the voice, \"My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says  it\\r\\nall really doesn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Errr ...\" said Zaphod sympathetically.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And that is why  I,  as  a  disembodied  mind,  have  this  job,\\r\\nCustodian  of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk\\r\\non the ground of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex  -\\r\\nthey don\\'t really count I\\'m afraid.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Many years ago this was  a  thriving,  happy  planet  -  people,\\r\\ncities  shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of\\r\\nthese cities there were slightly more shoe shops than  one  might\\r\\nhave  thought  necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of\\r\\nthese shoe shops were increasing.  It\\'s  a  well  known  economic\\r\\nphenomenon  but  tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe\\r\\nshops there were, the more shoes they had to make and  the  worse\\r\\nand more unwearable they became. And the worse they were to wear,\\r\\nthe more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the  more\\r\\nthe  shops  proliferated,  until  the  whole economy of the place\\r\\npassed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event  Horizon,  and  it\\r\\nbecame  no  longer  economically possible to build anything other\\r\\nthan shoe shops. Result - collapse, ruin and famine. Most of  the\\r\\npopulation  died out. Those few who had the right kind of genetic\\r\\ninstability mutated into birds - you\\'ve seen one of  them  -  who\\r\\ncursed  their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should\\r\\nwalk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come,  I  must  take  you  to  the\\r\\nVortex.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled  forward  across\\r\\nthe plain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And you,\" he said, \"you come from this hellhole pit do you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No no,\" said Gargravarr, taken aback, \"I come from the  Frogstar\\r\\nWorld C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in\\r\\nthe evenings. Though all  I  can  do  now  is  watch.  The  Total\\r\\nPerspective  Vortex  is  the  only  thing on this planet with any\\r\\nfunction. It was built here because no  one  else  wanted  it  on\\r\\ntheir doorstep.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAt that moment another dismal scream  rent  the  air  and  Zaphod\\r\\nshuddered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What can do that to a guy?\" he breathed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The Universe,\"  said  Gargravarr  simply,  \"the  whole  infinite\\r\\nUniverse. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them,\\r\\nand yourself an invisible dot on  an  invisible  dot,  infinitely\\r\\nsmall.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, I\\'m Zaphod Beeblebrox,  man,  you  know,\"  muttered  Zaphod\\r\\ntrying to flap the last remnants of his ego.\\r\\n \\r\\nGargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming\\r\\ntill  they  reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the\\r\\nplain.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs they reached it, a door hummed open in the side,  revealing  a\\r\\nsmall darkened chamber within.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Enter,\" said Gargravarr.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod started with fear.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, what, now?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Now.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was  very  small.  It\\r\\nwas  steel-lined  and  there was hardly space in it for more than\\r\\none man.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It ... er ... it doesn\\'t look like any kind of  Vortex  to  me,\"\\r\\nsaid Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It isn\\'t,\" said Gargravarr, \"it\\'s just the elevator. Enter.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nWith infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of\\r\\nGargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied\\r\\nman was not for the moment speaking.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe elevator began its descent.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I must get myself into  the  right  frame  of  mind  for  this,\"\\r\\nmuttered Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There is no right frame of mind,\" said Gargravarr sternly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I don\\'t. The Vortex does.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAt the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the  elevator  opened  up\\r\\nand  Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined\\r\\nchamber.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt the far side of it stood a  single  upright  steel  box,  just\\r\\nlarge enough for a man to stand in.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was that simple.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt connected to a small pile of components and instruments via  a\\r\\nsingle thick wire.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is that it?\" said Zaphod in surprise.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That is it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nDidn\\'t look too bad, thought Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And I get in there do I?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You get in there,\" said Gargravarr, \"and I\\'m afraid you must  do\\r\\nit now.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK, OK,\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe opened the door of the box and stepped in.\\r\\n \\r\\nInside the box he waited.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was\\r\\nthere in the box with him.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Total Perspective Vortex derives its  picture  of  the  whole\\r\\nUniverse on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo explain - since every piece of matter in the  Universe  is  in\\r\\nsome way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe,\\r\\nit is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of  creation  -\\r\\nevery  sun,  every  planet,  their  orbits, their composition and\\r\\ntheir economic and social history from, say, one small  piece  of\\r\\nfairy cake.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe  man  who  invented  the  Total  Perspective  Vortex  did  so\\r\\nbasically in order to annoy his wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nTrin Tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a  thinker,\\r\\na  speculative  philosopher  or,  as  his  wife would have it, an\\r\\nidiot.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd she would nag him incessantly about  the  utterly  inordinate\\r\\namount  of  time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over\\r\\nthe mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of\\r\\npieces of fairy cake.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Have some sense of proportion!\"  she  would  say,  sometimes  as\\r\\noften as thirty-eight times in a single day.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show her.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd into one end he plugged the whole of reality as  extrapolated\\r\\nfrom a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his\\r\\nwife: so that when he turned it on she saw  in  one  instant  the\\r\\nwhole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo Trin Tragula\\'s horror, the shock  completely  annihilated  her\\r\\nbrain;  but  to  his  satisfaction he realized that he had proved\\r\\nconclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this\\r\\nsize,  then  the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of\\r\\nproportion.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe door of the Vortex swung open.\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly.  He  had\\r\\nrather  liked  Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was\\r\\nclearly a man of many qualities, even if  they  were  mostly  bad\\r\\nones.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe waited for him to flop forwards out of the box,  as  they  all\\r\\ndid.\\r\\n \\r\\nInstead, he stepped out.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hi!\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Beeblebrox ...\" gasped Gargravarr\\'s mind in amazement.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Could I have a drink please?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You ... you ... have been in the Vortex?\" stammered Gargravarr.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You saw me, kid.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And it was working?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Sure was.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And you saw the whole infinity of creation?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Sure. Really neat place, you know that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nGargravarr\\'s mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body  been\\r\\nwith  him  it  would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging\\r\\nopen.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And you saw yourself,\" said Gargravarr, \"in relation to it all?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, yeah, yeah.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But ... what did you experience?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod shrugged smugly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It just told me what I knew all the time. I\\'m a really  terrific\\r\\nand great guy. Didn\\'t I tell you, baby, I\\'m Zaphod Beeblebrox!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHis gaze passed over the machinery which powered the  vortex  and\\r\\nsuddenly stopped, startled.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe breathed heavily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey,\" he said, \"is that really a piece of fairy cake?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors  with\\r\\nwhich it was surrounded.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If I told you how much I needed this,\" he  said  ravenously,  \"I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t have time to eat it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe ate it.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n \\r\\n A short while later he was  running  across  the  plain  in  the\\r\\ndirection of the ruined city.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe dank air wheezed heavily  in  his  lungs  and  he  frequently\\r\\nstumbled  with  the  exhaustion  he  was still feeling. Night was\\r\\nbeginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe elation of his recent experience was still with  him  though.\\r\\nThe  whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to\\r\\ninfinity around him - everything. And with it had come the  clear\\r\\nand  extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing\\r\\nin it. Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually  being  told\\r\\nby a machine is another.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe didn\\'t have time to reflect on this matter.\\r\\n \\r\\nGargravarr had told him that he would have to alert  his  masters\\r\\nas  to  what  had  happened,  but that he was prepared to leave a\\r\\ndecent interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a\\r\\nbreak and find somewhere to hide.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat he was going to do he didn\\'t know, but feeling that  he  was\\r\\nthe most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence\\r\\nto believe that something would turn up.\\r\\n \\r\\nNothing else on this blighted planet could give him much  grounds\\r\\nfor optimism.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe walked along cracked and gaping  roads  riddled  with  scrawny\\r\\nweeds,  the  holes  filled  with  rotting shoes. The buildings he\\r\\npassed were so crumbled and decrepit  he  thought  it  unsafe  to\\r\\nenter any of them. Where could he hide? He hurried on.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter a while the remains of a wide sweeping road  led  off  from\\r\\nthe  one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low\\r\\nbuilding,  surrounded  with  sundry  smaller  ones,   the   whole\\r\\nsurrounded  by the remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main\\r\\nbuilding still seemed reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off  to\\r\\nsee if it might provide him with ... well with anything.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe approached the building. Along one side of it - the  front  it\\r\\nwould  seem  since  it  faced  a wide concreted apron area - were\\r\\nthree gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these\\r\\nwas open, and towards this, Zaphod ran.\\r\\n \\r\\nInside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over\\r\\neverything.  Part  of  the  infrastructure  of  the  building had\\r\\ncollapsed, part of the rear  wall  had  caved  in,  and  a  thick\\r\\nchoking dust lay inches over the floor.\\r\\n \\r\\nThrough the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe  shapes  were  sometimes  cylindrical,   sometimes   bulbous,\\r\\nsometimes  like  eggs,  or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were\\r\\nsplit open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey were all spacecraft, all derelict.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was nothing\\r\\nhere  that  remotely  approached  the  serviceable. Even the mere\\r\\nvibration  of  his  footsteps  caused  one  precarious  wreck  to\\r\\ncollapse further into itself.\\r\\n \\r\\nTowards the rear of the  building  lay  one  old  ship,  slightly\\r\\nlarger  than  the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of\\r\\ndust and cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed  unbroken.  Zaphod\\r\\napproached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an\\r\\nold feedline.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe tried  to  toss  the  feedline  aside,  and  to  his  surprise\\r\\ndiscovered that it was still connected to the ship.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was  also\\r\\nhumming slightly.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe stared at the ship in disbelief, and then  back  down  at  the\\r\\nfeedline in his hands.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on  his\\r\\nhands  and  knees  he followed the feedline to the point where it\\r\\nconnected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight\\r\\nhumming vibration was more distinct.\\r\\n \\r\\nHis heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid  an\\r\\near  against  the  ship\\'s  side.  He  could  only  hear  a faint,\\r\\nindeterminate noise.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor  all\\r\\nabout  him  and  found  a  short  length  of  tubing,  and a non-\\r\\nbiodegradable plastic cup. Out  of  this  he  fashioned  a  crude\\r\\nstethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat he heard made his brains turn somersaults.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe voice said:\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize  to  passengers\\r\\nfor  the  continuing  delay  to  this  flight.  We  are currently\\r\\nawaiting the loading of  our  complement  of  small  lemon-soaked\\r\\npaper  napkins  for  your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during\\r\\nthe journey. Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The  cabin\\r\\ncrew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe walked around for a few moments in a  daze.  In  so  doing  he\\r\\nsuddenly  caught  sight of a giant departure board still hanging,\\r\\nbut by only one support, from  the  ceiling  above  him.  It  was\\r\\ncovered   with   grime,  but  some  of  the  figures  were  still\\r\\ndiscernible.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod\\'s eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some  brief\\r\\ncalculations. His eyes widened.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nine hundred years ...\" he breathed to  himself.  That  was  how\\r\\nlate the ship was.\\r\\n \\r\\nTwo minutes later he was on board.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs he stepped out of the airlock, the air that  greeted  him  was\\r\\ncool and fresh - the air conditioning was still working.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe lights were still on.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe moved out of the small entrance chamber into  a  short  narrow\\r\\ncorridor and stepped nervously down it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSuddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Please return to your seat sir,\"  said  the  android  stewardess\\r\\nand,  turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in\\r\\nfront of him.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen his heart had started beating again  he  followed  her.  She\\r\\nopened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe followed her through the door.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey were now in the passenger  compartment  and  Zaphod\\'s  heart\\r\\nstopped still again for a moment.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe passengers\\' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were\\r\\nlong, the men wore beards.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll of them were quite clearly alive - but sleeping.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod had the creeping horrors.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was\\r\\nhalf-way  down  the  aisle,  the stewardess had reached the other\\r\\nend. She turned and spoke.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,\" she said  sweetly,  \"Thank\\r\\nyou  for  bearing  with  us  during this slight delay. We will be\\r\\ntaking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to  wake\\r\\nup now I will serve you coffee and biscuits.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThere was a slight hum.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt that moment, all the passengers awoke.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support\\r\\nsystems  that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and\\r\\nbawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently  moved  up\\r\\nthe  aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits\\r\\nin front of each one of them.\\r\\n \\r\\nThen one of them rose from his seat.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe turned and looked at Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod\\'s skin was crawling all over his body as if it was  trying\\r\\nto get off. He turned and ran from the bedlam.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe plunged through the door and back into the corridor.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man pursued him.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe raced in a frenzy to the end  of  the  corridor,  through  the\\r\\nentrance  chamber  and  beyond.  He  arrived  on the flight deck,\\r\\nslammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the\\r\\ndoor breathing hard.\\r\\n \\r\\nWithin seconds, a hand started beating on the door.\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return  to\\r\\nyour seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits\\r\\nare being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please  return\\r\\nto your seat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod said nothing. He  breathed  hard,  behind  him,  the  hand\\r\\ncontinued to knock on the door.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Please return to your seat,\" repeated the autopilot. \"Passengers\\r\\nare not allowed on the flight deck.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m not a passenger,\" panted Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Please return to your seat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I am not a passenger!\" shouted Zaphod again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Please return to your seat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I am not a ... hello, can you hear me?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Please return to your seat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nYou\\'re the autopilot?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the voice from the flight console.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re in charge of this ship?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the voice again, \"there has been a delay.  Passengers\\r\\nare  to  be  kept  temporarily  in suspended animation, for their\\r\\ncomfort and convenience. Coffee and  biscuits  are  being  served\\r\\nevery  year,  after  which  passengers  are returned to suspended\\r\\nanimation for their continued comfort and convenience.  Departure\\r\\nwill take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize\\r\\nfor the delay.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod moved away from the door, on which the  pounding  had  now\\r\\nceased. He approached the flight console.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Delay?\" he cried, \"Have you seen the world  outside  this  ship?\\r\\nIt\\'s  a  wasteland,  a desert. Civilization\\'s been and gone, man.\\r\\nThere  are  no  lemon-soaked  paper  napkins  on  the  way   from\\r\\nanywhere!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The statistical likelihood,\" continued the autopilot primly, \"is\\r\\nthat  other  civilizations  will  arise.  There  will  one day be\\r\\nlemon-soaked paper napkins. Till  then  there  will  be  a  short\\r\\ndelay. Please return to your seat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nBut at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see  the\\r\\nman  who  had  pursued  him  standing  there.  He carried a large\\r\\nbriefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had\\r\\nno beard and no long fingernails.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod Beeblebrox,\" he said, \"My name is  Zarniwoop.  I  believe\\r\\nyou wanted to see me.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said  foolish  things.  He\\r\\ndropped into a chair.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ve been waiting here for you,\" he said in a businesslike tone.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe put the briefcase down and sat in another chair.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I am glad you followed instructions,\" he  said,  \"I  was  a  bit\\r\\nnervous  that  you  might  have left my office by the door rather\\r\\nthan the window. Then you would have been in trouble.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod shook his heads at him and burbled.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"When  you  entered  the  door  of  my  office,  you  entered  my\\r\\nelectronically  synthesized  Universe,\" he explained, \"if you had\\r\\nleft by the door you would have been back in the  real  one.  The\\r\\nartificial one works from here.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe patted the briefcase smugly.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s the difference?\" he muttered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said Zarniwoop, \"they are identical. Oh - except  that\\r\\nI think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" spat Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Simple,\" said Zarniwoop. His self assurance  and  smugness  made\\r\\nZaphod seethe.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Very simple,\" repeated Zarniwoop, \"I discovered the  coordinated\\r\\nat  which  this  man  could  be  found  -  the  man who rules the\\r\\nUniverse, and discovered that  his  world  was  protected  by  an\\r\\nUnprobability  field.  To  protect  my  secret  -  and myself - I\\r\\nretreated to the safety of this totally artificial  Universe  and\\r\\nhid  myself  away  in  a  forgotten  cruise  liner. I was secure.\\r\\nMeanwhile, you and I ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You and I?\" said Zaphod angrily, \"you mean I knew you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Zarniwoop, \"we knew each other well.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I had no taste,\" said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Meanwhile,  you  and  I  arranged  that  you  would  steal   the\\r\\nImprobability  Drive  ship  -  the only one which could reach the\\r\\nruler\\'s world - and bring it to me here. This you have now done I\\r\\ntrust,  and  I  congratulate you.\" He smiled a tight little smile\\r\\nwhich Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, and in case you  were  wondering,\"  added  Zarniwoop,  \"this\\r\\nUniverse  was  created  specifically  for you to come to. You are\\r\\ntherefore the most important person in this Universe.  You  would\\r\\nnever,\" he said with an even more brickable smile, \"have survived\\r\\nthe Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where?\" said Zaphod sullenly.

You did bring it I trust?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where is your jacket?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked at him in mystification.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"My jacket? I took it off. It\\'s outside.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good, we will go and find it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him.\\r\\n \\r\\nOut in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of\\r\\nthe passengers being fed coffee and biscuits.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It has not been a pleasant experience  waiting  for  you,\"  said\\r\\nZarniwoop.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Not pleasant for you!\" bawled Zaphod, \"How do you think ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung  open.\\r\\nA few feet away from them they could see Zaphod\\'s jacket lying in\\r\\nthe debris.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A very remarkable  and  very  powerful  ship,\"  said  Zarniwoop,\\r\\n\"watch.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAs they watched, the pocket on the  jacket  suddenly  bulged.  It\\r\\nsplit, it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that\\r\\nZaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its\\r\\nfull size.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"At an Improbability Level,\" said Zarniwoop, \"of ... oh  I  don\\'t\\r\\nknow, but something very large.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod swayed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean I had it with me all the time?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe twisted a single switch inside it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Goodbye artificial Universe,\" he said, \"hello real one!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared  exactly\\r\\nas before.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You see?\" said Zarniwoop, \"exactly the same.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n \"You mean,\" repeated Zaphod tautly, \"that I had it with  me  all\\r\\nthe time?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Zarniwoop, \"of course. That was the whole point.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Zaphod, \"you can count me out, from  hereon  in\\r\\nyou  can count me out. I\\'ve had all I want of this. You play your\\r\\nown games.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m afraid you cannot leave,\" said Zarniwoop, \"you are  entwined\\r\\nin the Improbability field.

Arthur!\"  he  shouted,  \"it\\'s  working!  The   ship\\'s\\r\\nreactivated!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nTrillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Come on you guys, we\\'re going off, we\\'re off,\" he  said  kicking\\r\\nthem awake.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hi there guys!\" twittered the computer, \"it\\'s really great to be\\r\\nback  with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Shut up,\" said Ford, \"tell us where the hell we are.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Frogstar World B, and man it\\'s a dump,\" said Zaphod  running  on\\r\\nto the bridge, \"hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me\\r\\nyou don\\'t even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What a what?\" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from  the\\r\\nfloor and not taking any of this in.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I know how you feel,\" said Zaphod, \"I\\'m  so  great  even  I  get\\r\\ntongue-tied talking to myself.

Consciousness\\r\\nhad  died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the\\r\\npit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally  around  them\\r\\nand  they  sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red\\r\\nthat slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying\\r\\non  a  cold  hard  shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of\\r\\nLife, the Universe, and Everything.\\r\\n \\r\\nCold spasms shook them, lights danced  sickeningly  around  them.\\r\\nThe  cold  hard  shore  tipped  and span and then stood still. It\\r\\nshone darkly - it was a very highly polished cold hard shore.\\r\\n \\r\\nA green blur watched them disapprovingly.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt coughed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good evening,  madam,  gentlemen,\"  it  said,  \"do  you  have  a\\r\\nreservation?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord Prefect\\'s consciousness snapped back  like  elastic,  making\\r\\nhis brain smart. He looked up woozily at the green blur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Reservation?\" he said weakly. \"Yes, sir,\" said the green blur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIn so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows\\r\\ndisdainfully, this is what the green blur now did.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Afterlife, sir?\" it said.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur Dent was grappling with  his  consciousness  the  way  one\\r\\ngrapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is this the afterlife?\" he stammered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well I assume so,\" said Ford Prefect trying to  work  out  which\\r\\nway was up. He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite\\r\\ndirection from the cold hard shore on which  he  was  lying,  and\\r\\nstaggered to what he hoped were his feet.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I mean,\" he said, swaying gently, \"there\\'s no way we could  have\\r\\nsurvived that blast is there?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but\\r\\nit didn\\'t seem to improve things. He slumped down again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Trillian, standing up, \"no way at all.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It  was  Zaphod\\r\\nBeeblebrox  attempting to speak. \"I certainly didn\\'t survive,\" he\\r\\ngurgled, \"I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, thanks to you,\" said Ford, \"We didn\\'t stand a  chance.  We\\r\\nmust have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks  ...\"  said\\r\\nthe green blur, hovering impatiently beside them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Kerpow, splat,\" continued Zaphod, \"instantaneously  zonked  into\\r\\nour  component molecules. Hey, Ford,\" he said, identifying one of\\r\\nthe slowly solidifying blurs around him, \"did you get that  thing\\r\\nof your whole life flashing before you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You got that too?\" said Ford, \"your whole life?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod, \"at least I assume it was mine.  I  spent  a\\r\\nlot of time out of my skulls you know.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe looked at around him at the various shapes that were  at  last\\r\\nbecoming  proper  shapes  instead of vague and wobbling shapeless\\r\\nshapes.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So ...\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So what?\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So here we are,\" said Zaphod hesitantly, \"lying dead ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Standing,\" Trillian corrected him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, standing dead,\" continued Zaphod, \"in this desolate ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Restaurant,\" said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and  could\\r\\nnow, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing\\r\\nthat surprised him was not that he could see, but what  he  could\\r\\nsee.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Here we are,\" continued Zaphod doggedly, \"standing dead in  this\\r\\ndesolate ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Five star ...\" said Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Restaurant,\" concluded Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Odd isn\\'t it?\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, yeah.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nice chandeliers though,\" said Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey looked about themselves in bemusement.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s not so much an afterlife,\" said Arthur,  \"more  a  sort  of\\r\\napres vie.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and  the\\r\\nlow  vaulted  ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal\\r\\nUniverse, have been painted in  that  particular  shade  of  deep\\r\\nturquoise,  and  even  if  it  had  been  it  wouldn\\'t  have been\\r\\nhighlighted by concealed moodlighting. This is not,  however,  an\\r\\nideal  Universe,  as  was  further  evidenced by the eye-crossing\\r\\npatterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the  way  in  which  the\\r\\nfronting  for  the  eighty-yard  long  marble-topped bar had been\\r\\nmade. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had\\r\\nbeen  made  by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean\\r\\nMosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that  the  twenty  thousand\\r\\nlizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in.\\r\\n \\r\\nA few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar\\r\\nor  relaxing  in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were\\r\\ndeployed here and there about  the  bar  area.  A  young  Vl\\'Hurg\\r\\nofficer  and  his  green  steaming  young lady passed through the\\r\\nlarge smoked glass doors at the far  end  of  the  bar  into  the\\r\\ndazzling light of the main body of the Restaurant beyond.\\r\\n \\r\\nBehind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He  pulled  aside\\r\\nthe  corner  of  the  curtain and looked out at a landscape which\\r\\nunder normal circumstances would have given Arthur  the  creeping\\r\\nhorrors.  These  were not, however, normal circumstances, for the\\r\\nthing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up  his\\r\\nback and off the top of his head was the sky. The sky was ...\\r\\n \\r\\nAn attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"All in good time, sir,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod\\'s eyes flashed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, hang about you dead guys,\" he said, \"I think we\\'re  missing\\r\\nsome ultra-important thing here you know. Something somebody said\\r\\nand we missed it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he\\r\\nhad just seen.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe said, \"I said it was a sort of apres ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, and don\\'t you wish you hadn\\'t?\" said Zaphod, \"Ford?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I said it was odd.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" interrupted the  green  blur  who  had  by  this  time\\r\\nresolved  into  the  shape  of  a small wizened dark-suited green\\r\\nwaiter, \"perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Drinks!\" cried Zaphod, \"that was it! See what you  miss  if  you\\r\\ndon\\'t stay alert.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Indeed sir,\"  said  the  waiter  patiently.  \"If  the  lady  and\\r\\ngentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Dinner!\" Zaphod exclaimed with passion,  \"Listen,  little  green\\r\\nperson,  my  stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night\\r\\nfor the mere idea.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"... and the Universe,\" concluded the waiter, determined  not  to\\r\\nbe  deflected  on  his home stretch, \"will explode later for your\\r\\npleasure.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord\\'s head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Wow,\" he said, \"What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe waiter laughed a polite little waiter\\'s laugh.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, I hope not,\" breathed Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe waiter coughed a polite little waiter\\'s cough.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It is not unusual for our customers to be a  little  disoriented\\r\\nby the time journey,\" he said, \"so if I might suggest ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Time journey?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Time journey?\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Time journey?\" said Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean this isn\\'t the afterlife?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe waiter smiled a polite little waiter\\'s smile. He  had  almost\\r\\nexhausted  his  polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be\\r\\nslipping into his role of a rather  tight  lipped  and  sarcastic\\r\\nlittle waiter.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Afterlife sir?\" he said, \"No sir.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And we\\'re not dead?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe waiter tightened his lips.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Aha, ha,\" he said, \"Sir is most  evidently  alive,  otherwise  I\\r\\nwould not attempt to serve sir.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIn an extraordinary gesture  which  is  pointless  attempting  to\\r\\ndescribe,  Zaphod  Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two\\r\\nof his arms and one of his thighs with the other.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey guys,\" he said, \"This  is  crazy.  We  finally  did  it.  We\\r\\nfinally got to where we were going. This is Milliways!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes sir,\" said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel,\\r\\n\"this is Milliways - the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"End of what?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The  Universe,\"  repeated   the   waiter,   very   clearly   and\\r\\nunnecessarily distinctly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"When did that end?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"In just a few minutes, sir,\" said the waiter.  He  took  a  deep\\r\\nbreath.  He  didn\\'t  need  to do this since his body was supplied\\r\\nwith the peculiar assortment of gases it  required  for  survival\\r\\nfrom  a  small  intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are\\r\\ntimes, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take  a\\r\\ndeep breath.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Now, if you would care to order drinks at  last,\"  he  said,  \"I\\r\\nwill then show you to your table.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over  to  the  bar  and\\r\\nbought most of it.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is  one  of  the  most\\r\\nextraordinary  ventures in the entire history of catering.

All the important changes have happened before the things\\r\\nthey  were  supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the\\r\\nend.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe major problem is quite simply one of grammar,  and  the  main\\r\\nwork  to  consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner\\'s Time\\r\\nTraveller\\'s Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will  tell  you\\r\\nfor  instance  how to describe something that was about to happen\\r\\nto you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping  forward\\r\\ntwo  days  in  order  to  avoid  it.  The event will be described\\r\\ndifferently according to whether you are talking  about  it  from\\r\\nthe  standpoint  of  your  own  natural  time, from a time in the\\r\\nfurther future, or a time in the  further  past  and  is  further\\r\\ncomplicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst\\r\\nyou are actually travelling from one time  to  another  with  the\\r\\nintention of becoming your own father or mother.\\r\\n \\r\\nMost readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified\\r\\nSubinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up:\\r\\nand in fact in later editions of the book all  the  pages  beyond\\r\\nthis point have been left blank to save on printing costs.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the  Galaxy  skips  lightly  over  this\\r\\ntangle  of  academic  abstraction,  pausing only to note that the\\r\\nterm \"Future Perfect\" has been abandoned since it was  discovered\\r\\nnot to be.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo resume:\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is  one  of  the  most\\r\\nextraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is built on the fragmented remains  of  an  eventually  ruined\\r\\nplanet  which  is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble\\r\\nand projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of\\r\\nthe Universe.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is, many would say, impossible.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat\\r\\n(willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen)\\r\\nthe whole of creation explode around them.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is, many would say, equally impossible.\\r\\n \\r\\nYou can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any  sitting  you  like\\r\\nwithout  prior  (late fore-when) reservation because you can book\\r\\nretrospectively, as it were when you return  to  your  own  time.\\r\\n(you  can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta\\r\\nretrohome.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt the Restaurant you can meet and dine with  (mayan  meetan  con\\r\\nwith  dinan  on  when)  a fascinating cross-section of the entire\\r\\npopulation of space and time.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible.\\r\\n \\r\\nYou can visit it as many times as you like  (mayan  on-visit  re-\\r\\nonvisiting  ... and so on - for further tense-corrections consult\\r\\nDr Streetmentioner\\'s book) and be sure of never meeting yourself,\\r\\nbecause of the embarrassment this usually causes.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis, even if the rest were true, which  it  isn\\'t,  is  patently\\r\\nimpossible, say the doubters.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings  account  in\\r\\nyour  own  era,  and  when  you  arrive  at  the  End of Time the\\r\\noperation of compound interest means that the  fabulous  cost  of\\r\\nyour meal has been paid for.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis, many claim, is not merely impossible  but  clearly  insane,\\r\\nwhich  is  why  the  advertising executives of the star system of\\r\\nBastablon  came  up  with  this  slogan:  \"If  you\\'ve  done   six\\r\\nimpossible  things  this  morning,  why  not  round  it  off with\\r\\nbreakfast  at  Milliways,  the  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the\\r\\nUniverse?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n \\r\\nAt the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a  newt.

They  were  waiting  for the greatest show in the\\r\\nUniverse.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, Zaphod,\" said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of\\r\\nthe  third  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster, missing. He pointed a\\r\\nswaying finger.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There\\'s an old mate of mine,\" he said,  \"Hotblack  Desiato!  See\\r\\nthe man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod tried to follow Ford\\'s finger with his eyes  but  it  made\\r\\nhim feel dizzy. Finally he saw.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yeah,\" he said, then recognition came a moment later.  \"Hey,\"\\r\\nhe said, \"did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the\\r\\nbiggest thing ever. Other than me.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Who\\'s he supposed to be?\" asked Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hotblack Desiato?\" said Zaphod in astonishment, \"you don\\'t know?\\r\\nYou never heard of Disaster Area?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Trillian, who hadn\\'t.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The biggest,\" said Ford, \"loudest ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Richest ...\" suggested Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"... rock band in the history of ...\" he searched for the word.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"... history itself,\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zowee,\" said Zaphod, \"here we are at the End of the Universe and\\r\\nyou haven\\'t even lived yet. Did you miss out.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time\\r\\nat the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, er, Hotblack,\" he called out, \"how you doing? Great to  see\\r\\nyou  big boy, how\\'s the noise? You\\'re looking great, really very,\\r\\nvery fat and unwell. Amazing.\" He slapped the man on the back and\\r\\nwas mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan\\r\\nGalactic Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him  told  him  to\\r\\nplunge on regardless.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Remember the old days?\" he said, \"We used to  hang  out,  right?\\r\\nThe   Bistro  Illegal,  remember?  Slim\\'s  Throat  Emporium?  The\\r\\nEvildrome Boozarama, great days eh?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great\\r\\ndays or not. Ford was not perturbed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And when we were hungry we\\'d pose as public  health  inspectors,\\r\\nyou  remember  that?  And go around confiscating meals and drinks\\r\\nright? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then  there  were  the\\r\\nlong  nights  of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above\\r\\nthe Cafe Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always  in\\r\\nthe  next  room  trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all\\r\\nhated them. And you said you didn\\'t care,  and  we  said  we  did\\r\\nbecause  we  hated  them  so much.\" Ford\\'s eyes were beginning to\\r\\nmist over.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And you said you didn\\'t  want  to  be  a  star,\"  he  continued,\\r\\nwallowing  in  nostalgia,  \"because you despised the star system.\\r\\nAnd we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn\\'t  think  you\\r\\nhad the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Here,\" he said, \"is a man who buys star systems!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or  deny  this\\r\\nfact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think someone\\'s drunk,\" muttered a purple bush-like being into\\r\\nhis wine glass.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing\\r\\nHotblack Desiato.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s that number you do?\" he  said,  unwisely  grabbing  at  a\\r\\nbottle  for  support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as\\r\\nit happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That really huge number,\" he continued, \"how does it go? `Bwarm!\\r\\nBwarm!  Baderr!!\\'  something, and in the stage act you do it ends\\r\\nup with this ship crashing right into the sun, and  you  actually\\r\\ndo it!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat\\r\\ngraphically. He knocked the bottle over again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!\" he  cried.  \"I  mean  forget  lasers  and\\r\\nstuff,  you  guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and\\r\\nterrible songs.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHis eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle\\r\\non to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, you want a drink?\" he said.  It  began  to  sink  into  his\\r\\nsquelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and\\r\\nthat the missing something was in some  way  connected  with  the\\r\\nfact  that  the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit\\r\\nand the silvery trilby had not yet said \"Hi, Ford\" or  \"Great  to\\r\\nsee you after all this time,\" or in fact anything at all. More to\\r\\nthe point he had not yet even moved.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hotblack?\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nA large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and  pushed\\r\\nhim aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to\\r\\nsee if he could spot the owner of  this  discourteous  hand.  The\\r\\nowner  was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of\\r\\nthe order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with  it.  In\\r\\nfact  he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy\\r\\nand with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into  which  the  man\\'s\\r\\nbody  had been stuffed looked as if it\\'s only purpose in life was\\r\\nto demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into\\r\\na  suit.  The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of\\r\\nan apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Kid ...\" said a voice which emerged from the man\\'s mouth  as  if\\r\\nit had been having a really rough time down in his chest.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, yeah?\" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to  his\\r\\nfeet  again  and was disappointed that the top of his head didn\\'t\\r\\ncome further up the man\\'s body.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Beat it,\" said the man.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yeah?\" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being,  \"and  who\\r\\nare you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man considered this for a moment. He  wasn\\'t  used  to  being\\r\\nasked  this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came\\r\\nup with an answer.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m the guy who\\'s telling you to beat it,\" he said, \"before  you\\r\\nget it beaten for you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Now listen,\" said Ford nervously - he wished his head would stop\\r\\nspinning,  settle down and get to grips with the situation - \"Now\\r\\nlisten,\" he continued, \"I am one of Hotblack\\'s oldest friends and\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn\\'t moved so much as\\r\\nan eyelash.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"... and ...\" said Ford again, wondering what  would  be  a  good\\r\\nword to say after \"and\".\\r\\n \\r\\nThe large man came up with a whole sentence to go after \"and\". He\\r\\nsaid it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And I am Mr Desiato\\'s bodyguard,\" it went, \"and I am responsible\\r\\nfor his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away\\r\\nbefore it gets damaged.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Now wait a minute,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No minutes!\" boomed  the  bodyguard,  \"no  waiting!  Mr  Desiato\\r\\nspeaks to no one!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well perhaps you\\'d let him say what he thinks about  the  matter\\r\\nhimself,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"He speaks to no one!\" bellowed the bodyguard.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to  admit\\r\\nto  himself  that  the  bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his\\r\\nside. There was still not the slightest  sign  of  movement,  let\\r\\nalone keen interest in Ford\\'s welfare.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why?\" said Ford, \"What\\'s the matter with him?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe bodyguard told him.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a\\r\\nplutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally\\r\\nheld to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy,  but  in\\r\\nfact  the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers\\r\\njudge that the best sound balance is usually  to  be  heard  from\\r\\nwithin  large  concrete  bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the\\r\\nstage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments  by\\r\\nremote  control  from  within a heavily insulated spaceship which\\r\\nstays in orbit around the planet - or more  frequently  around  a\\r\\ncompletely different planet.\\r\\n \\r\\nTheir songs are on the whole very simple and  mostly  follow  the\\r\\nfamiliar  theme  of  boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery\\r\\nmoon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.\\r\\n \\r\\nMany worlds have now banned their act altogether,  sometimes  for\\r\\nartistic  reasons,  but  most  commonly because the band\\'s public\\r\\naddress  system  contravenes  local  strategic  arms  limitations\\r\\ntreaties.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis has not, however, stopped their earnings from  pushing  back\\r\\nthe boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research\\r\\naccountant   has   recently   been   appointed    Professor    of\\r\\nNeomathematics  at  the University of Maximegalon, in recognition\\r\\nof both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax\\r\\nReturns,  in  which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-\\r\\ntime continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord staggered  back  to  the  table  where  Zaphod,  Arthur  and\\r\\nTrillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Gotta have some food,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hi, Ford,\" said Zaphod, \"you speak to the big noise boy?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord waggled his head noncommittally.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'d he say?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, not a lot really. He\\'s ... er ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"He\\'s spending a year dead for  tax  reasons.  I\\'ve  got  to  sit\\r\\ndown.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe sat down.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe waiter approached.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Would you like to see the menu?\" he said, \"or would you like  to\\r\\nmeet the Dish of the Day?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Huh?\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Huh?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Huh?\" said Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s cool,\" said Zaphod, \"we\\'ll meet the meat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIn a small room in one of the arms of the  Restaurant  complex  a\\r\\ntall,  thin,  gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion\\r\\nlooked him in the face.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him\\r\\nin  it  so  many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too\\r\\nsunken and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips  were  too\\r\\nthin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much\\r\\nlike a recently polished bay window.  The  hands  that  held  the\\r\\ncurtain  were  long  and  thin too: they were also cold. They lay\\r\\nlightly along the folds of the curtain and  gave  the  impression\\r\\nthat if he didn\\'t watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of\\r\\ntheir own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on\\r\\nhis  features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled\\r\\naround his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening\\'s\\r\\npreying,  finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table,\\r\\nwhere he leafed through a few sheets of jokes.\\r\\n \\r\\nA bell rang.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His  hands\\r\\nbrushed  limply  over  some  of  the one million rainbow-coloured\\r\\nsequins with which his jacket was  festooned,  and  he  was  gone\\r\\nthrough the door.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace,\\r\\na single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway\\r\\nthat led up to the centre of the stage.\\r\\n \\r\\nUp the stairs bounded bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure.\\r\\nHe  burst  on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone,\\r\\nremoved it from its stand with one swoop of his  long  thin  hand\\r\\nand  stood  for  a  moment  bowing left and right to the audience\\r\\nacknowledging their applause  and  displaying  to  them  his  bay\\r\\nwindow.  He  waved to his particular friends in the audience even\\r\\nthough there weren\\'t any there, and waited for  the  applause  to\\r\\ndie down.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not  merely\\r\\nfrom  ear  to  ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere\\r\\nconfines of his face.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!\" he cried, \"thank you very much.\\r\\nThank you so much.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe eyed them with a twinkling eye.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"The Universe as we know it  has\\r\\nnow  been  in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand\\r\\nmillion billion years and will be ending in a little over half an\\r\\nhour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the\\r\\nEnd of the Universe!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nWith a gesture he deftly conjured another  round  of  spontaneous\\r\\napplause. With another gesture he cut it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I  am  your  host  for  tonight,\"  he  said,  \"my  name  is  Max\\r\\nQuordlepleen  ...\"  (Everybody  knew  this,  his  act  was famous\\r\\nthroughout the known  Galaxy,  but  he  said  it  for  the  fresh\\r\\napplause  it  generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming\\r\\nsmile and wave.) \"... and I\\'ve just come straight from  the  very\\r\\nvery other end of time, where I\\'ve been hosting a show at the Big\\r\\nBang Burger Bar - where I can tell you we  had  a  very  exciting\\r\\nevening  ladies  and  gentlemen  -  and  I will be with you right\\r\\nthrough this historic occasion, the End of History itself!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnother burst of applause died away quickly as the lights  dimmed\\r\\ndown   further.   On   every  table  candles  ignited  themselves\\r\\nspontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all  the  diners  and\\r\\nwreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million\\r\\nintimate shadows. A tremor of  excitement  thrilled  through  the\\r\\ndarkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very\\r\\nvery slowly to dim, to darken, to fade.\\r\\n \\r\\nMax\\'s voice was hushed as he continued.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So, ladies and gentlemen,\" he breathed, \"the  candles  are  lit,\\r\\nthe  band  plays  softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us\\r\\nfades into transparency, revealing a dark  and  sullen  sky  hung\\r\\nheavy  with  the  ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see\\r\\nwe\\'re all in for a fabulous evening\\'s apocalypse!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nEven the soft tootling of the band faded away  as  stunned  shock\\r\\ndescended on all those who had not seen this sight before.\\r\\n \\r\\nA monstrous, grisly light poured in on them,\\r\\n \\r\\n- a hideous light,\\r\\n \\r\\n- a boiling, pestilential light,\\r\\n \\r\\n- a light that would have disfigured hell.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Universe was coming to an end.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor a few  interminable  seconds  the  Restaurant  span  silently\\r\\nthrough the raging void. Then Max spoke again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the  end  of\\r\\nthe tunnel,\" he said, \"this is it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe band struck up again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\" cried Max, \"I\\'ll be back  with\\r\\nyou again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very\\r\\ncapable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his  cataclysmic  Combo.  Big\\r\\nhand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe baleful turmoil of the skies continued.\\r\\n \\r\\nHesitantly the audience began to clap and after a  moment  or  so\\r\\nnormal  conversation  resumed. Max began his round of the tables,\\r\\nswapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living.\\r\\n \\r\\nA large dairy animal  approached  Zaphod  Beeblebrox\\'s  table,  a\\r\\nlarge  fat  meaty  quadruped of the bovine type with large watery\\r\\neyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating\\r\\nsmile on its lips.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good evening,\" it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, \"I\\r\\nam  the  main  Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my\\r\\nbody?\" It  harrumphed  and  gurgled  a  bit,  wriggled  its  hind\\r\\nquarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n \\r\\nIts gaze was met by looks of startled  bewilderment  from  Arthur\\r\\nand Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger\\r\\nfrom Zaphod Beeblebrox.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Something off  the  shoulder  perhaps?\"  suggested  the  animal,\\r\\n\"Braised in a white wine sauce?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, your shoulder?\" said Arthur in a horrified whisper.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But naturally my shoulder, sir,\" mooed the  animal  contentedly,\\r\\n\"nobody else\\'s is mine to offer.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod leapt to his feet and started  prodding  and  feeling  the\\r\\nanimal\\'s shoulder appreciatively.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Or the rump is very  good,\"  murmured  the  animal.  \"I\\'ve  been\\r\\nexercising  it  and  eating  plenty of grain, so there\\'s a lot of\\r\\ngood meat there.\" It gave  a  mellow  grunt,  gurgled  again  and\\r\\nstarted to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Or a casserole of me perhaps?\" it added.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean this animal actually wants us  to  eat  it?\"  whispered\\r\\nTrillian to Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Me?\" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes,  \"I  don\\'t  mean\\r\\nanything.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s  absolutely  horrible,\"  exclaimed  Arthur,   \"the   most\\r\\nrevolting thing I\\'ve ever heard.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s the problem Earthman?\" said Zaphod, now transferring  his\\r\\nattention to the animal\\'s enormous rump.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I just don\\'t want to eat an animal that\\'s standing here inviting\\r\\nme to,\" said Arthur, \"it\\'s heartless.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Better than eating an animal that doesn\\'t  want  to  be  eaten,\"\\r\\nsaid Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s not the point,\" Arthur protested. Then he  thought  about\\r\\nit  for  a  moment. \"Alright,\" he said, \"maybe it is the point. I\\r\\ndon\\'t care, I\\'m not going to think about it now. I\\'ll just ... er\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Universe raged about him in its death throes.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think I\\'ll just have a green salad,\" he muttered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"May I urge you to consider my liver?\" asked the animal, \"it must\\r\\nbe  very  rich  and tender by now, I\\'ve been force-feeding myself\\r\\nfor months.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A green salad,\" said Arthur emphatically.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A green salad?\" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly\\r\\nat Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Are you going to tell me,\" said Arthur, \"that I  shouldn\\'t  have\\r\\ngreen salad?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" said the animal, \"I know many vegetables  that  are  very\\r\\nclear  on  that  point. Which is why it was eventually decided to\\r\\ncut through the whole tangled problem and breed  an  animal  that\\r\\nactually  wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly\\r\\nand distinctly. And here I am.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIt managed a very slight bow.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Glass of water please,\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look,\" said Zaphod, \"we want to eat, we don\\'t  want  to  make  a\\r\\nmeal  of  the  issues.  Four  rare  steaks  please, and hurry. We\\r\\nhaven\\'t eaten in five hundred and  seventy-six  thousand  million\\r\\nyears.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good,\"  it  said,\\r\\n\"I\\'ll just nip off and shoot myself.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Don\\'t worry, sir,\" he said, \"I\\'ll be very humane.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIt waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen.\\r\\n \\r\\nA matter of minutes later  the  waiter  arrived  with  four  huge\\r\\nsteaming  steaks.  Zaphod  and  Ford  wolfed  straight  into them\\r\\nwithout a second\\'s hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and\\r\\nstarted into hers.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur stared at his feeling slightly ill.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, Earthman,\" said Zaphod with a malicious grin  on  the  face\\r\\nthat wasn\\'t stuffing itself, \"what\\'s eating you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd the band played on.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and  chatted.\\r\\nThe  air  was  filled  with  talk  of this and that, and with the\\r\\nmingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and  insidious\\r\\nwines.  For  an  infinite  number of miles in every direction the\\r\\nuniversal  cataclysm  was  gathering  to  a  stupefying   climax.\\r\\nGlancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And now, ladies and gentlemen,\" he beamed, \"is  everyone  having\\r\\none last wonderful time?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" called out the sort of people  who  call  out  \"yes\"  when\\r\\ncomedians ask them if they\\'re having a wonderful time.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s wonderful,\" enthused Max, \"absolutely wonderful.  And  as\\r\\nthe  photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing\\r\\nto tear apart the last of the red hot suns,  I  know  you\\'re  all\\r\\ngoing  to  settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find\\r\\nall an immensely exciting and terminal experience.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen,\"  he  said,  \"there\\'s  nothing\\r\\npenultimate about this one.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe paused again. Tonight his timing was  immaculate.  Time  after\\r\\ntime  he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word\\r\\nnight had any meaning here at the extremity of  time.  All  there\\r\\nwas  was  the  endless  repetition  of  the  final moment, as the\\r\\nRestaurant  rocked  slowly  forward  over  the  brink  of  time\\'s\\r\\nfurthest edge - and back again. This \"night\" was good though, the\\r\\naudience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand.  His  voice\\r\\ndropped. They had to strain to hear him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This,\" he said, \"really is the absolute end, the final  chilling\\r\\ndesolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes\\r\\nextinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial `it\\'.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a  fly  would\\r\\nnot have dared cleat its throat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"After this,\"  he  said,  \"there  is  nothing.  Void.  Emptiness.\\r\\nOblivion. Absolute nothing ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHis eyes glittered again - or did they twinkle?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nothing ... except of course for the sweet trolley, and  a  fine\\r\\nselection of Aldebaran liqueurs!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe band gave him a musical sting. He wished  they  wouldn\\'t,  he\\r\\ndidn\\'t  need  it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the\\r\\naudience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with\\r\\nrelief. He followed on.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And for once,\" he cried cheerily, \"you don\\'t need to worry about\\r\\nhaving  a  hangover  in  the morning - because there won\\'t be any\\r\\nmore mornings!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up  at  the\\r\\nsky,  going  through  the  same dead routine every night, but his\\r\\nglance was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it  to  do\\r\\nits job, as one professional trusts another.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And now,\" he said, strutting about the stage, \"at  the  risk  of\\r\\nputting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here\\r\\nthis evening, I would like to welcome a few parties.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe pulled a card from his pocket.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do we have ...\" he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, \"Do we\\r\\nhave  a  party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club\\r\\nfrom beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear.\\r\\nHe peered around trying to find them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Are they here?\" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe got it, as he always did.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids  lads  -  and  no  cheating,\\r\\nremember this is a very solemn moment.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe lapped up the laughter.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And do we also have, do we have ... a  party  of  minor  deities\\r\\nfrom the Halls of Asgard?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAway to his right came  a  rumble  of  thunder.  Lightning  arced\\r\\nacross  the  stage.  A  small group of hairy men with helmets sat\\r\\nlooking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n \\r\\nHasbeens, he thought to himself.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Careful with that hammer, sir,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey did their trick with the lightning again. Max  gave  them  a\\r\\nvery thin lipped smile.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And thirdly,\" he said, \"thirdly a party of  Young  Conservatives\\r\\nfrom Sirius B, are they here?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing  rolls  at\\r\\neach  other  and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped\\r\\nand barked unintelligibly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Max, \"well this is all your fault, you realize that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And finally,\" said Max, quieting the audience down  and  putting\\r\\non  his  solemn  face,  \"finally  I  believe we have with us here\\r\\ntonight, a party of believers, very devout  believers,  from  the\\r\\nChurch of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThere were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of\\r\\nthe  floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously,\\r\\nand staying apart from the festivities. They blinked  resentfully\\r\\nas the spotlight was turned on them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There they are,\" said Max, \"sitting there,  patiently.  He  said\\r\\nhe\\'d  come again, and he\\'s kept you waiting a long time, so let\\'s\\r\\nhope he\\'s hurrying fellas, because he\\'s only  got  eight  minutes\\r\\nleft!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe party of  Zarquon\\'s  followers  sat  rigid,  refusing  to  be\\r\\nbuffeted  by  the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n \\r\\nMax restrained his audience.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, but seriously though folks,  seriously  though,  no  offence\\r\\nmeant.  No,  I know we shouldn\\'t make fun of deeply held beliefs,\\r\\nso I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe audience clapped respectfully.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"... wherever he\\'s got to!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe blew a kiss to the  stony-faced  party  and  returned  to  the\\r\\ncentre of the stage.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe grabbed a tall stool and sat on it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s marvellous though,\" he rattled on, \"to see so many  of  you\\r\\nhere  tonight  -  no isn\\'t it though? Yes, absolutely marvellous.\\r\\nBecause I know that so many of you come here time and time again,\\r\\nwhich  I  think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final\\r\\nend of everything, and then return home to your own eras ...  and\\r\\nraise  families,  strive  for  new  and  better  societies, fight\\r\\nterrible wars for what you know to be right ... it  really  gives\\r\\none  hope  for  the future of all lifekind. Except of course,\" he\\r\\nwaved at the blitzing turmoil above and  around  them,  \"that  we\\r\\nknow it hasn\\'t got one ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur turned to Ford - he hadn\\'t quite got this place worked out\\r\\nin his mind.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look, surely,\" he said, \"if the Universe is  about  to  end  ...\\r\\ndon\\'t we go with it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in  other\\r\\nwords a rather unsteady one.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" he said, \"look,\" he said, \"as soon as you  come  into  this\\r\\ndive you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal\\r\\nwarp thing. I think.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup\\r\\nhe\\'d managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look,\" said Ford, \"I\\'ll show you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly  with\\r\\nit.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look,\" he said  again,  \"imagine  this  napkin,  right,  as  the\\r\\ntemporal Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode\\r\\nin the matter curve ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIt took him a while to say this last part, and  Arthur  hated  to\\r\\ninterrupt him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s the spoon I was eating with,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" said Ford, \"imagine this spoon ...\" he found  a  small\\r\\nwooden spoon on a tray of relishes, \"this spoon ...\" but found it\\r\\nrather tricky to pick up, \"no, better still this fork ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey would you let go of my fork?\" snapped Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" said Ford, \"alright, alright. Why don\\'t we say ... why\\r\\ndon\\'t we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What, the one you\\'ve just knocked on the floor?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Did I do that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" said Ford, \"forget that. I mean ... I mean,  look,  do\\r\\nyou know - do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick\\r\\noff?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Probably not,\" said Arthur, who wished he\\'d  never  embarked  on\\r\\nany of this.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" said Ford, \"imagine this. Right. You  get  this  bath.\\r\\nRight. A large round bath. And it\\'s made of ebony.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where from?\" said Arthur, \"Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Doesn\\'t matter.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So you keep saying.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Listen.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You get this bath, see? Imagine you\\'ve got this bath.  And  it\\'s\\r\\nebony. And it\\'s conical.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Conical?\" said Arthur, \"What sort of ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Shhh!\" said Ford. \"It\\'s conical. So what you do is, you see, you\\r\\nfill it with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand,\\r\\nand/or sugar. Anything. Doesn\\'t matter. Sugar\\'s  fine.  And  when\\r\\nit\\'s full, you pull the plug out ... are you listening?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m listening.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls  away\\r\\nyou see, out of the plughole.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I see.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You don\\'t see. You don\\'t see at all. I haven\\'t got to the clever\\r\\nbit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Tell me the clever bit.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the clever bit.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit\\r\\nwas.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The clever bit,\" he said, \"is this. You film it happening.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Clever.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s not the clever bit. This is the clever  bit,  I  remember\\r\\nnow  that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then\\r\\nthread the film in the projector ... backwards!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Backwards?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely  the  clever  bit.  So\\r\\nthen,  you  just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to\\r\\nspiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And that\\'s how the Universe began is it?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Ford, \"but it\\'s a marvellous way to relax.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe reached for his wine glass.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where\\'s my wine glass?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s on the floor.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nTipping back his chair to look for it,  Ford  collided  with  the\\r\\nsmall  green  waiter  who  was  approaching  the table carrying a\\r\\nportable telephone.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because\\r\\nhe was extremely drunk.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly\\r\\nunderstood.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug\\r\\nhis forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Mr Zaphod Beeblebrox?\" inquired the waiter.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, yeah?\" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There is a phone call for you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, what?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A phone call, sir.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nOne of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the  food\\r\\nit was still shovelling in.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Excuse me if I carry on, won\\'t you?\" said his  eating  head  and\\r\\ncarried on.\\r\\n \\r\\nThere were now so many people  after  him  he\\'d  lost  count.  He\\r\\nshouldn\\'t  have  made  such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not\\r\\nthough, he thought. How do you know you\\'re having fun if  there\\'s\\r\\nno one watching you have it?\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Maybe  someone  here  tipped  off  the  Galactic  Police,\"  said\\r\\nTrillian. \"Everyone saw you come in.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean they want to arrest me over the  phone?\"  said  Zaphod,\\r\\n\"Could be. I\\'m a pretty dangerous dude when I\\'m concerned.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said a voice from under the table, \"you go to  pieces  so\\r\\nfast people get hit by the shrapnel.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?\" snapped Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do we get to see that as well?\" asked Arthur nervously.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m in no hurry,\" muttered Zaphod, \"OK, so who\\'s the cat on  the\\r\\nphone?\"  He kicked Ford. \"Hey get up there, kid,\" he said to him,\\r\\n\"I may need you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I am not,\" said the  waiter,  \"personally  acquainted  with  the\\r\\nmetal gentlemen in question, sir ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Metal?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Did you say metal?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally  acquainted  with  the\\r\\nmetal gentleman in question ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK, carry on.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your  return  for  a\\r\\nconsiderable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat\\r\\nprecipitately.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Left here?\" said Zaphod, \"are you being strange?  We  only  just\\r\\narrived here.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Indeed, sir,\" persisted the waiter  doggedly,  \"but  before  you\\r\\narrived here, sir, I understand that you left here.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re saying,\" he said, \"that before we arrived here,  we  left\\r\\nhere?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is going to be a long night, thought the waiter.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Precisely, sir,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Put your analyst on danger money, baby,\" advised Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, wait a minute,\" said Ford, emerging above table level again,\\r\\n\"where exactly is here?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But we just left there,\" protested Zaphod, \"we  left  there  and\\r\\ncame to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the waiter, feeling that he  was  now  into  the\\r\\nhome  stretch  and  running well, \"the one was constructed on the\\r\\nruins of the other.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Arthur brightly, \"you mean we\\'ve travelled in time but\\r\\nnot in space.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Listen you semi-evolved simian,\" cut in Zaphod, \"go climb a tree\\r\\nwill you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur bristled.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Go bang your heads together four-eyes,\" he advised Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, no,\" the waiter said to Zaphod,  \"your  monkey  has  got  it\\r\\nright, sir.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur stuttered in fury and said  nothing  apposite,  or  indeed\\r\\ncoherent.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You jumped forward ... I believe five  hundred  and  seventy-six\\r\\nthousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place,\"\\r\\nexplained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling  that\\r\\nhe  had  finally  won  through  against  what  had  seemed  to be\\r\\ninsuperable odds.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s it!\" said Zaphod, \"I got it. I told the computer to  send\\r\\nus  to the nearest place to eat, that\\'s exactly what it did. Give\\r\\nor take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million  years,  we\\r\\nnever moved. Neat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey all agreed this was very neat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But who,\" said Zaphod, \"is the cat on the phone?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Whatever happened to Marvin?\" said Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod clapped his hands to his heads.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"When was this?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six  thousand  million  years\\r\\nago I suppose,\" said Zaphod, \"Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate\\r\\nCaptain.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe little waiter\\'s  eyebrows  wandered  about  his  forehead  in\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, sir?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The phone, waiter,\" said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. \"Shee, you\\r\\nguys are so unhip it\\'s a wonder your bums don\\'t fall off.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Indeed, sir.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, Marvin, is that you?\" said Zaphod into the phone, \"How  you\\r\\ndoing, kid?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThere was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think you ought to know I\\'m feeling very depressed,\" it said.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod cupped his hands over the phone.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s Marvin,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, Marvin,\" he said into the  phone  again,  \"we\\'re  having  a\\r\\ngreat  time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe\\r\\ngoing foom. Where can we find you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAgain the pause.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You don\\'t have to pretend to be interested in me you know,\" said\\r\\nMarvin at last, \"I know perfectly well I\\'m only a menial robot.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK, OK,\" said Zaphod, \"but where are you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"`Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,\\' that\\'s what they  say  to  me,\\r\\n`open  airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that\\r\\npiece of paper?\\' Can I pick up that piece of paper!  Here  I  am,\\r\\nbrain the size of a planet and they ask me to ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" sympathized Zaphod hardly at all.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But I\\'m quite used to being humiliated,\" droned Marvin,  \"I  can\\r\\neven go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would\\r\\nyou like me to go and stick my head in a bucket  of  water?  I\\'ve\\r\\ngot one ready. Wait a minute.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, hey, Marvin ...\" interrupted Zaphod, but it  was  too  late.\\r\\nSad little clunks and gurgles came up the line.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s he saying?\" asked Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said Zaphod, \"he just phoned up to wash  his  head  at\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There,\" said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit,\\r\\n\"I hope that gave satisfaction ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" said Zaphod, \"now will you please tell us where you\\r\\nare?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m in the car park,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The car park?\" said Zaphod, \"what are you doing there?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK, hang in there, we\\'ll be right down.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIn one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw  down  the  phone\\r\\nand wrote \"Hotblack Desiato\" on the bill.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Come on guys,\" he said, \"Marvin\\'s in the car park. Let\\'s get  on\\r\\ndown.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s he doing in the car park?\" asked Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But what about the End of  the  Universe?  We\\'ll  miss  the  big\\r\\nmoment.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ve seen it. It\\'s rubbish,\" said Zaphod, \"nothing  but  a  gnab\\r\\ngib.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A what?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let\\'s get zappy.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFew of the other diners paid them any attention  as  they  weaved\\r\\ntheir  way  through  the  Restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were\\r\\nriveted on the horror of the skies.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"An interesting effect to watch for,\" Max was telling  them,  \"is\\r\\nin  the  upper  left-hand  quadrant of the sky, where if you look\\r\\nvery carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away\\r\\ninto the ultra-violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThere were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere  at\\r\\nthe back.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" said Max beaming cheerfully at them, \"it\\'s  too  late  to\\r\\nworry about whether you left the gas on now.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n \\r\\nThe main reception foyer was almost empty but  Ford  nevertheless\\r\\nweaved his way through it.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred  him  into  a\\r\\ncubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are you doing to him?\" asked Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Sobering him up,\" said Zaphod and pushed a  coin  into  a  slot.\\r\\nLights flashed, gases swirled.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hi,\" said Ford stepping  out  a  moment  later,  \"where  are  we\\r\\ngoing?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Down to the car park, come on.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What about the personnel Time Teleports?\"  said  Ford,  \"Get  us\\r\\nstraight back to the Heart of Gold.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, but I\\'ve cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop  can  have  it.  I\\r\\ndon\\'t want to play his games. Let\\'s see what we can find.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA  Sirius   Cybernetics   Corporation   Happy   Vertical   People\\r\\nTransporter  took  them  down deep into the substrata beneath the\\r\\nRestaurant. They were glad to see  it  had  been  vandalized  and\\r\\ndidn\\'t try to make them happy as well as take them down.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a  blast  of\\r\\ncold stale air hit them.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long  concrete\\r\\nwall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for\\r\\nall of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every  car  park\\r\\nin  the  Galaxy  throughout the entire history of car parks, this\\r\\ncar park smelt predominantly of impatience.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey turned a corner and found themselves  on  a  moving  catwalk\\r\\nthat traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the\\r\\ndim distance.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship\\r\\nbelonging  to  one  of  the  diners  upstairs,  some smallish and\\r\\nutilitarian  mass  production   models,   others   vast   shining\\r\\nlimoships, the playthings of the very rich.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod\\'s eyes sparkled with something that may or  may  not  have\\r\\nbeen  avarice  as  he  passed  over them. In fact it\\'s best to be\\r\\nclear on this point - avarice is definitely what it was.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There he is,\" said Trillian, \"Marvin, down there.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a  small\\r\\nmetal  figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner\\r\\nof a giant silver suncruiser.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt short intervals along the  moving  catwalk,  wide  transparent\\r\\ntubes  led  down  to  floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk\\r\\ninto one and  floated  gently  downwards.  The  others  followed.\\r\\nThinking  back  to  this  later,  Arthur  Dent thought it was the\\r\\nsingle most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, Marvin,\" said Zaphod striding over towards  to  him,  \"Hey,\\r\\nkid, are we pleased to see you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin turned, and in so far as it  is  possible  for  a  totally\\r\\ninert metal face to look reproachfully, this is what it did.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No you\\'re not,\" he said, \"no one ever is.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Suit yourself,\" said Zaphod and turned away to ogle  the  ships.\\r\\nFord went with him.\\r\\n \\r\\nOnly Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, really we are,\" said Trillian and patted him in a  way  that\\r\\nhe  disliked  intensely,  \"hanging around waiting for us all this\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand  million,  three  thousand\\r\\nfive  hundred  and  seventy-nine  years,\" said Marvin, \"I counted\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, here we are now,\" said Trillian, felling - quite correctly\\r\\nin Marvin\\'s view - that it was a slightly foolish thing to say.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The first ten million years were the worst,\" said  Marvin,  \"and\\r\\nthe  second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third\\r\\nmillion years I didn\\'t enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit\\r\\nof decline.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe paused just long enough to make them feel they  ought  to  say\\r\\nsomething, and then interrupted.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s the people you meet in this job that really get you  down,\"\\r\\nhe said and paused again.\\r\\n \\r\\nTrillian cleared her throat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is that ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The best conversation I had was over forty million  years  ago,\"\\r\\ncontinued Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\nAgain the pause.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh d ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And that was with a coffee machine.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe waited.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s a ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You don\\'t like talking to me do  you?\"  said  Marvin  in  a  low\\r\\ndesolate tone.\\r\\n \\r\\nTrillian talked to Arthur instead.\\r\\n \\r\\nFurther down the chamber Ford  Prefect  had  found  something  of\\r\\nwhich he very much liked the look, several such things in fact.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod,\" he said in a quiet voice, \"just look at some  of  these\\r\\nlittle star trolleys ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked and liked.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe craft they were looking at  was  in  fact  pretty  small  but\\r\\nextraordinary, and very much a rich kid\\'s toy. It was not much to\\r\\nlook at. It resembled nothing so  much  as  a  paper  dart  about\\r\\ntwenty  feet  long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear\\r\\nend was a small horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny  charm-\\r\\ndrive  engine,  which  was  not capable of moving it at any great\\r\\nspeed. The thing it did have, however, was a heat-sink.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand  billion  tons  and\\r\\nwas  contained  within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic\\r\\nfield situated half-way along the length of the  ship,  and  this\\r\\nheat-sink  enabled  the  craft  to  be manoeuvred to within a few\\r\\nmiles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the  solar  flares\\r\\nthat burst out from its surface.\\r\\n \\r\\nFlare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in\\r\\nexistence,  and  those who can dare and afford it are amongst the\\r\\nmost  lionized  men  in  the  Galaxy.  It  is  also   of   course\\r\\nstupefyingly  dangerous  -  those who don\\'t die riding invariably\\r\\ndie of sexual exhaustion at one of  the  Daedalus  Club\\'s  Apres-\\r\\nFlare parties.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord and Zaphod looked and passed on.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And this baby,\" said Ford, \"the tangerine star  buggy  with  the\\r\\nblack sunbusters ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAgain, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally  misnamed  one\\r\\nin   fact,   because   the  one  thing  it  couldn\\'t  manage  was\\r\\ninterstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty  planet  hopper\\r\\ndolled  up to something it wasn\\'t. Nice lines though. They passed\\r\\non.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach  built\\r\\nlimoship  and  obviously  designed  with one aim in mind, that of\\r\\nmaking the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork  and  accessory\\r\\ndetail  clearly  said  \"Not  only am I rich enough to afford this\\r\\nship, I am also rich enough not to take  it  seriously.\"  It  was\\r\\nwonderfully hideous.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Just look at  it,\"  said  Zaphod,  \"multi-cluster  quark  drive,\\r\\nperspulex running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe examined every inch.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said,  \"look,  the  infra-pink  lizard  emblem  on  the\\r\\nneutrino cowling. Lazlar\\'s trade mark. The man has no shame.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I was passed by one of these  mothers  once,  out  by  the  Axel\\r\\nNebula,\"  said  Ford,  \"I  was going flat out and this thing just\\r\\nstrolled  past  me,  star  drive  hardly   ticking   over.   Just\\r\\nincredible.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod whistled appreciatively.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ten seconds later\", said Ford, \"it  smashed  straight  into  the\\r\\nthird moon of Jaglan Beta.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, right?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a  fish,  moves  like  a\\r\\nfish, steers like a cow.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord looked round the other side.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, come and see,\" he called out, \"there\\'s a big mural  painted\\r\\non  this  side. A bursting sun - Disaster Area\\'s trade mark. This\\r\\nmust be Hotblack\\'s ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this  terrible\\r\\nsong  you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun.\\r\\nMeant to be  an  amazing  spectacle.  Expensive  in  stunt  ships\\r\\nthough.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod\\'s attention  however  was  elsewhere.  His  attention  was\\r\\nriveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato\\'s limo. His\\r\\nmouths hung open.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That,\" he said, \"that ... is really bad for the eyes ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord looked. He too stood astonished.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon,\\r\\ntwenty  yards  long,  very  clean, very sleek. There was just one\\r\\nremarkable thing about it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s so ... black!\" said Ford Prefect, \"you can hardly make  out\\r\\nits shape ... light just seems to fall into it!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost  impossible\\r\\nto tell how close you were standing to it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Your eyes just slide off it ...\" said Ford in wonder. It was  an\\r\\nemotional moment. He bit his lip.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a  man  possessed  -  or\\r\\nmore  accurately  like  a  man  who  wanted  to possess. His hand\\r\\nreached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached  out\\r\\nto stroke it again. His hand stopped again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Come and feel the surface,\" he said in a hushed voice.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You ... you can\\'t ...\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"See?\" said Zaphod, \"it\\'s just totally frictionless. This must be\\r\\none mother of a mover ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of  his  heads\\r\\ndid - the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What do you reckon, Ford?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean ... er ...\" Ford looked over his  shoulder.  \"You  mean\\r\\nstroll off with it? You think we should?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nor do I.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But we\\'re going to, aren\\'t we?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How can we not?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly  pulled  himself\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We better shift soon,\" he said. \"In a moment or so the  Universe\\r\\nwill  have  ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down\\r\\nhere to find their bourge-mobiles.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How do we do it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Simple,\" said Zaphod. He turned. \"Marvin!\" he called.\\r\\n \\r\\nSlowly, laboriously, and  with  a  million  little  clanking  and\\r\\ncreaking  noises  that  he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned\\r\\nround to answer the summons.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Come on over here,\" said Zaphod, \"We\\'ve got a job for you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin trudged towards them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I won\\'t enjoy it,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes you will,\"  enthused  Zaphod,  \"there\\'s  a  whole  new  life\\r\\nstretching out ahead of you.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, not another one,\" groaned Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Will you shut up and listen!\" hissed Zaphod, \"this time  there\\'s\\r\\ngoing to be excitement and adventure and really wild things.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Sounds awful,\" Marvin said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Marvin! All I\\'m trying to ask you ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What? Er ... yes. Yeah, that\\'s right,\" said Zaphod  jumpily.  He\\r\\nwas keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well I wish you\\'d just tell me rather  than  try  to  engage  my\\r\\nenthusiasm,\" said Marvin, \"because I haven\\'t got one.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe walked on up to the ship, touched it,  and  a  hatchway  swung\\r\\nopen.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord and Zaphod stared at the opening.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Don\\'t mention it,\" said Marvin, \"Oh,  you  didn\\'t.\"  He  trudged\\r\\naway again.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur and Trillian clustered round.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s happening?\" asked Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look at this,\" said Ford, \"look at the interior of this ship.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Weirder and weirder,\" breathed Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s black,\" said Ford, \"Everything in it is just totally  black\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment  after\\r\\nwhich there wouldn\\'t be any more moments.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll eyes were fixed on the dome, other  than  those  of  Hotblack\\r\\nDesiato\\'s  bodyguard,  which  were  looking  intently at Hotblack\\r\\nDesiato,  and  those  of  Hotblack  Desiato  himself  which   the\\r\\nbodyguard had closed out of respect.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato\\r\\nbeen  alive,  he probably would have deemed this a good moment to\\r\\nlean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was  not  a\\r\\nman  which improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate\\r\\ncondition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Mr Desiato, sir?\" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it\\r\\nlooked  as  if  the  muscles  on  either  side  of his mouth were\\r\\nclambering over each other to get out of the way.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hotblack?\" hissed the bodyguard.\\r\\n \\r\\nAgain,  quite  naturally,  Hotblack  Desiato   did   not   reply.\\r\\nSupernaturally, however, he did.\\r\\n \\r\\nOn the table in front of him a wine glass  rattled,  and  a  fork\\r\\nrose  an  inch  or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on\\r\\nthe table again.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s time we get going, Mr  Desiato,\"  muttered  the  bodyguard,\\r\\n\"don\\'t want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You\\r\\nwant to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a  really\\r\\nbig  audience  for  it.  One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred\\r\\nseventy-six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have\\r\\nbeen looking forward to it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of  way  and\\r\\ndropped again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, come on,\" said the  bodyguard,  \"it\\'s  going  to  have  been\\r\\ngreat.  You  knocked \\'em cold.\" The bodyguard would have given Dr\\r\\nDan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The black ship going into the sun always gets \\'em, and  the  new\\r\\none\\'s  a  beauty.  Be  real sorry to see it go. If we get on down\\r\\nthere, I\\'ll set the black ship autopilot and we\\'ll cruise off  in\\r\\nthe limo. OK?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe fork  tapped  once  in  agreement,  and  the  glass  of  wine\\r\\nmysteriously emptied itself.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe  bodyguard  wheeled  Hotblack  Desiato\\'s  chair  out  of  the\\r\\nRestaurant.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And now,\" cried Max from the centre of the  stage,  \"the  moment\\r\\nyou\\'ve  all  been  waiting  for!\" He flung his arms into the air.\\r\\nBehind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling\\r\\nsynthochords.  Max  had  argued with them about this but they had\\r\\nclaimed it was in their contract that that\\'s what they would  do.\\r\\nHis agent would have to sort it out.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The skies begin to boil!\" he cried. \"Nature collapses  into  the\\r\\nscreaming void! In twenty seconds\\' time, the Universe itself will\\r\\nbe at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe hideous fury of destruction blazed about them - and  at  that\\r\\nmoment  a  still  small  trumpet  sounded  as  from  an  infinite\\r\\ndistance. Max\\'s eyes swivelled round to glare at the  band.  None\\r\\nof  them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke\\r\\nwas swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet\\r\\nwas joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done\\r\\nthis show, and nothing like this had  ever  happened  before.  He\\r\\ndrew  back  in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a\\r\\nfigure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient  man,\\r\\nbearded,  robed and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and\\r\\non his brow a golden crown.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s this?\" whispered Max, wild-eyed, \"what\\'s happening?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAt the back of the Restaurant  the  stony-faced  party  from  the\\r\\nChurch  of  the  Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt\\r\\necstatically to their feet chanting and crying.\\r\\n \\r\\nMax blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen,\" he hollered, \"for  the\\r\\nGreat Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage  and\\r\\nhanded his microphone to the Prophet.\\r\\n \\r\\nZarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering.  The\\r\\nstars  in  his  eyes  blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone\\r\\nwith confusion.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er ...\" he said, \"hello. Er, look, I\\'m sorry  I\\'m  a  bit  late.\\r\\nI\\'ve  had  the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up\\r\\nat the last moment.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe seemed nervous of the expectant  awed  hush.  He  cleared  his\\r\\nthroat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, how are we for time?\" he said, \"have I just got a min-\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd so the Universe ended.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n \\r\\nOne of the major selling point of that wholly  remarkable  travel\\r\\nbook,  the  Hitch  Hiker\\'s  Guide  to  the Galaxy, apart from its\\r\\nrelative cheapness and the fact that it has the words Don\\'t Panic\\r\\nwritten   in   large  friendly  letters  on  its  cover,  is  its\\r\\ncompendious and occasionally accurate  glossary.  The  statistics\\r\\nrelating  to the geo-social nature of the Universe, for instance,\\r\\nare deftly set out between pages nine  hundred  and  thirty-eight\\r\\nthousand  and  twenty-four  and  nine  hundred  and  thirty-eight\\r\\nthousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in  which  they\\r\\nare  written  is  partly  explained by the fact that the editors,\\r\\nhaving to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information  off\\r\\nthe back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it\\r\\nwith a few footnoted in order  to  avoid  prosecution  under  the\\r\\nincomprehensibly tortuous Galactic Copyright laws.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the\\r\\nbook  backwards  in  time  through  a  temporal  warp,  and  then\\r\\nsuccessfully sued the breakfast cereal company  for  infringement\\r\\nof the same laws.\\r\\n \\r\\nHere is a sample:\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Universe - some information to help you live in it.\\r\\n \\r\\n1~Area: Infinite.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy offers this  definition  of\\r\\nthe word \"Infinite\".\\r\\n \\r\\nInfinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some.  Much\\r\\nbigger  than  that  in  fact, really amazingly immense, a totally\\r\\nstunning size, \"wow, that\\'s big\", time. Infinity is just  so  big\\r\\nthat  by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic\\r\\nmultiplied by colossal multiplied by  staggeringly  huge  is  the\\r\\nsort of concept we\\'re trying to get across here.\\r\\n \\r\\n2~Imports: None.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is impossible to import things into an  infinite  area,  there\\r\\nbeing no outside to import things in from.\\r\\n \\r\\n3~Exports: None.\\r\\n \\r\\nSee imports.\\r\\n \\r\\n4~Population: None.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is known that there are an infinite number of  worlds,  simply\\r\\nbecause  there  is an infinite amount of space for them to be in.\\r\\nHowever, not every one of them  is  inhabited.  Therefore,  there\\r\\nmust  be  a  finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number\\r\\ndivided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes  no  odds,  so\\r\\nthe  average population of all the planets in the Universe can be\\r\\nsaid to be zero. From this it follows that the population of  the\\r\\nwhole  Universe  is  also  zero, and that any people you may meet\\r\\nfrom  time  to  time  are  merely  the  products  of  a  deranged\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n \\r\\n5~Monetary Units: None.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn fact there are three  freely  convertible  currencies  in  the\\r\\nGalaxy,  but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently\\r\\ncollapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead  is  only  exchangeable  for\\r\\nother  Flaninian  Pobble  Beads,  and the Triganic Pu has its own\\r\\nvery special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis  to  one\\r\\nPu  is  simple  enough,  but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber\\r\\ncoin six thousand eight hundred miles across each  side,  no  one\\r\\nhas  ever  collected  enough  to  own  one  Pu.  Ningis  are  not\\r\\nnegotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse  to  deal  in\\r\\nfiddling  small change. From this basic premise it is very simple\\r\\nto prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n \\r\\n6~Art: None.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there\\r\\nsimply isn\\'t a mirror big enough - see point one.\\r\\n \\r\\n7~Sex: None.\\r\\n \\r\\nWell, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely  because  of\\r\\nthe total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that\\r\\nmight keep all the non-existent people of the Universe occupied.\\r\\n \\r\\nHowever, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now\\r\\nbecause   it   really   is   terribly  complicated.  For  further\\r\\ninformation  see  Guide  Chapters  seven,  nine,   ten,   eleven,\\r\\nfourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four\\r\\ninclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n \\r\\nThe  Restaurant  continued  existing,  but  everything  else  had\\r\\nstopped.  Temporal  relastatics  held  it  and  protected it in a\\r\\nnothingness that wasn\\'t merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing  -\\r\\nthere was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque,  the\\r\\nparty  was  over,  the  diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished\\r\\nalong with the rest of  the  Universe,  the  Time  Turbines  were\\r\\npreparing to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in\\r\\nreadiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in\\r\\nhis  small  curtained  dressing room trying to raise his agent on\\r\\nthe tempophone.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn to the car park came the late Mr Hotblack  Desiato,  propelled\\r\\nalong the moving catwalk by his bodyguard.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey descended one of the tubes. As they approached the  limoship\\r\\na  hatchway  swung  down from its side, engaged the wheels of the\\r\\nwheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having\\r\\nseen  his  boss  safely connected up to his death-support system,\\r\\nmoved up to the  small  cockpit.  Here  he  operated  the  remote\\r\\ncontrol  system  which  activated the autopilot in the black ship\\r\\nlying next to the limo,  thus  causing  great  relief  to  Zaphod\\r\\nBeeblebrox  who  had  been trying to start the thing for over ten\\r\\nminutes.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe black ship glided smoothly forward out of  its  bay,  turned,\\r\\nand  moved  down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the\\r\\nend it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch\\r\\nchamber and began the long journey back into the distant past.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission,  a  passage  from\\r\\nthe Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this:\\r\\n \\r\\nThe History of every major Galactic Civilization  tends  to  pass\\r\\nthrough   three   distinct  and  recognizable  phases,  those  of\\r\\nSurvival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How,\\r\\nWhy and Where phases.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor instance, the first phase is characterized  by  the  question\\r\\n\"How  can  we  eat?\", the second by the question \"Why do we eat?\"\\r\\nand the third by the question, \"Where shall we have lunch?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the\\r\\nEnd  of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated\\r\\nanswer to that third question.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat it doesn\\'t go on to say is that though it will usually  take\\r\\na  large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the\\r\\nHow, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful\\r\\nconditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How are we doing?\" said Arthur Dent.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Badly,\" said Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where are we going?\" said Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Zaphod Beeblebrox.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why not?\" demanded Arthur Dent.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Shut up,\" suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Basically,  what  you\\'re  trying  to  say,\"  said  Arthur  Dent,\\r\\nignoring this suggestion, \"is that we\\'re out of control.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford  and  Zaphod\\r\\ntried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engined howled and\\r\\nwhined like tired children in a supermarket.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s the wild colour scheme that freaks me,\" said  Zaphod  whose\\r\\nlove  affair  with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into\\r\\nthe flight, \"Every time you try to  operate  on  of  these  weird\\r\\nblack  controls that are labelled in black on a black background,\\r\\na little black light lights up black to let you know you\\'ve  done\\r\\nit. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the  ceiling  was\\r\\nblack,  the  seats  -  which  were  rudimentary  since  the  only\\r\\nimportant trip this ship was designed  for  was  supposed  to  be\\r\\nunmanned   -  were  black,  the  control  panel  was  black,  the\\r\\ninstruments were black, the little screws that held them in place\\r\\nwere  black,  the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and\\r\\nwhen they had lifted up a corner of it they had  discovered  that\\r\\nthe foam underlay also was black.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different\\r\\nwavelengths,\" offered Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Or didn\\'t have much imagination,\" muttered Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Marvin, \"he was feeling very depressed.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIn fact, though they weren\\'t to  know  it,  the  decor  had  been\\r\\nchosen in honour of its owner\\'s sad, lamented, and tax-deductible\\r\\ncondition.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship gave a particularly sickening lurch.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Take it easy,\" pleaded Arthur, \"you\\'re making me space sick.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Time sick,\"  said  Ford,  \"we\\'re  plummeting  backwards  through\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Arthur, \"now I think I really am  going  to  be\\r\\nill.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Go ahead,\" said Zaphod, \"we could do with a little colour  about\\r\\nthis place.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation  is  it?\"\\r\\nsnapped Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over\\r\\nto Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look, Earthman,\" he said angrily,  \"you\\'ve  got  a  job  to  do,\\r\\nright? The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What, that thing?\" said Arthur, \"I thought we\\'d forgotten  about\\r\\nthat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it\\'s worth a lot of  money  in\\r\\nthe  right quarters. And it\\'s all locked up in that head thing of\\r\\nyours.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes but ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of  Life!  We  get  our\\r\\nfingers  on  that  we  can  hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to\\r\\nransom, and that\\'s worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" he said, \"but where do we start? How  should  I  know?\\r\\nThey  say  the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I\\r\\nsupposed to know what the question is? It could  be  anything.  I\\r\\nmean, what\\'s six times seven?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with\\r\\nexcitement.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Forty-two!\" he cried.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur wiped his palm across his forehead.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said patiently,\" I know that.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod\\'s faces fell.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m just saying that the question could  be  anything  at  all,\"\\r\\nsaid Arthur, \"and I don\\'t see how I am meant to know.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Because,\" hissed Zaphod, \"you were there when  your  planet  did\\r\\nthe big firework.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We have a thing on Earth ...\" began Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Had,\" corrected Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA low voice echoed dully round the cabin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I know,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord called out from the controls he was still fighting a  losing\\r\\nbattle with.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Stay out of this Marvin,\" he said, \"this is organism talk.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s printed in the Earthman\\'s  brainwave  patterns,\"  continued\\r\\nMarvin, \"but I don\\'t suppose you\\'ll be very interested in knowing\\r\\nthat.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean,\" said Arthur, \"you mean you can see into my mind?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur stared in astonishment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And ...?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Arthur, \"abuse.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" confirmed Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, ignore him,\" said Zaphod, \"he\\'s only making it up.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Making it up?\" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a  parody  of\\r\\nastonishment,  \"Why should I want to make anything up? Life\\'s bad\\r\\nenough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Marvin,\" said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she\\r\\nwas  still  capable  of  assuming  in talking to this misbegotten\\r\\ncreature, \"if you knew all along, why then didn\\'t you tell us?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMarvin\\'s head swivelled back to her.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You didn\\'t ask,\" he said simply.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, we\\'re asking you now, metal man,\" said Ford, turning round\\r\\nto look at him.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the\\r\\nengine pitch settled down to a gentle hum.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, Ford,\" said Zaphod, \"that sounds good. Have you worked  out\\r\\nthe controls of this boat?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Ford, \"I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon  we\\r\\njust go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, right,\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I could tell you weren\\'t really interested,\" murmured Marvin  to\\r\\nhimself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Trouble is,\" said Ford, \"that the one instrument in  this  while\\r\\nship  that  is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I\\r\\nthink it is, and if it\\'s saying what I think  it\\'s  saying,  then\\r\\nwe\\'ve  already  gone too far back into the past. Maybe as much as\\r\\ntwo million years before our own time.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod shrugged.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Time is bunk,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway,\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Me,\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No. Who it really belongs to.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Really me,\" insisted Zaphod, \"look, property  is  theft,  right?\\r\\nTherefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Tell the ship that,\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod strode over to the console.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ship,\" he said, banging on the panels, \"this is your  new  owner\\r\\nspeaking to ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe got no further. Several things happened at once.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real\\r\\nspace.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the\\r\\ntime trip now lit up.\\r\\n \\r\\nA  large  vision  screen  above  the  console  winked  into  life\\r\\nrevealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead\\r\\nof them.\\r\\n \\r\\nNone of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that\\r\\nZaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the\\r\\nrear of the cabin, as were all the others.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of  noise  that\\r\\nthuddered  out  of  the  monitor  speakers surrounding the vision\\r\\nscreen.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n \\r\\nDown on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in  the  middle  of  the\\r\\nvast  Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound\\r\\nsystem.\\r\\n \\r\\nThat is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage\\r\\ntechnicians.  They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area\\'s\\r\\ngiant control ship which hung in orbit some  four  hundred  miles\\r\\nabove  the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound\\r\\nsystem from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker  silos\\r\\nwouldn\\'t have survived the tuning up.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf Arthur Dent had been within five miles of  the  speaker  silos\\r\\nthen  his  expiring thought would have been that in both size and\\r\\nshape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the\\r\\nsilos,  the  neutron  phase  speaker  stacks  towered monstrously\\r\\nagainst the sky, obscuring the banks of  plutonium  reactors  and\\r\\nseismic amps behind them.\\r\\n \\r\\nBuried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers  lay\\r\\nthe instruments that the musicians would control from their ship,\\r\\nthe massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and  the  Megabang\\r\\ndrum complex.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was going to be a noisy show.\\r\\n \\r\\nAboard the giant control  ship,  all  was  activity  and  bustle.\\r\\nHotblack  Desiato\\'s  limoship,  a  mere  tadpole  beside  it, had\\r\\narrived  and  docked,  and  the  lamented  gentleman  was   being\\r\\ntransported  down  the  high vaulted corridors to meet the medium\\r\\nwho was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar\\r\\nkeyboard.\\r\\n \\r\\nA doctor, a  logician  and  a  marine  biologist  had  also  just\\r\\narrived,  flown  in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try\\r\\nto reason with the lead singer who  had  locked  himself  in  the\\r\\nbathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till\\r\\nit could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn\\'t a fish. The\\r\\nbass  player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer\\r\\nwas nowhere on board.\\r\\n \\r\\nFrantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on  a\\r\\nbeach  on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he\\r\\nclaimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found  a\\r\\nsmall stone that would be his friend.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe band\\'s manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the\\r\\nseventeenth  time  on  this  tour  the drums would be played by a\\r\\nrobot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would  be\\r\\nright.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe sub-ether was buzzing with the communications  of  the  stage\\r\\ntechnicians  testing  the  speaker channels, and this it was that\\r\\nwas being relayed to the interior of the black ship.\\r\\n \\r\\nIts dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the  cabin,  and\\r\\nlistened to the voices on the monitor speakers.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"OK, channel nine on  power,\"  said  a  voice,  \"testing  channel\\r\\nfifteen ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnother thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Channel fifteen AOK,\" said another voice.\\r\\n \\r\\nA third voice cut in.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The black stunt ship is now in position,\" it said, \"it\\'s looking\\r\\ngood. Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA computer voice answered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"On line,\" it said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Take control of the black ship.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Testing channel twenty.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod leaped across the cabin and switched  frequencies  on  the\\r\\nsub-ether  receiver  before  the  next mind-pulverizing noise hit\\r\\nthem. He stood there quivering.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What,\" said Trillian in  a  small  quiet  voice,  \"does  sundive\\r\\nmean?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It means,\" said Marvin, \"that the ship os going to dive into the\\r\\nsun.  Sun  ...  Dive. It\\'s very simple to understand. What do you\\r\\nexpect if you steal Hotblack Desiato\\'s stunt ship?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How do you know ...\" said Zaphod in a voice that  would  make  a\\r\\nVegan  snow  lizard feel chilly, \"that this is Hotblack Desiato\\'s\\r\\nstuntship?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Simple,\" said Marvin, \"I parked it for him.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The why ... didn\\'t ... you ... tell us!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You said you wanted excitement and  adventure  and  really  wild\\r\\nthings.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This is awful,\" said Arthur unnecessarily  in  the  pause  which\\r\\nfollowed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s what I said,\" confirmed Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\nOn a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up  a\\r\\npublic broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"... fine weather  for  the  concert  here  this  afternoon.  I\\'m\\r\\nstanding  here in front of the stage,\" the reporter lied, \"in the\\r\\nmiddle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the  aid  of  hyperbinoptic\\r\\nglasses  I  can  just  about  make out the huge audience cowering\\r\\nthere on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker  stacks\\r\\nrise  like  a  sheer  cliff  face,  and  high above me the sun is\\r\\nshining away and  doesn\\'t  know  what\\'s  going  to  hit  it.  The\\r\\nenvironmentalist  lobby  do know what\\'s going to hit it, and they\\r\\nclaim that the  concert  will  cause  earthquakes,  tidal  waves,\\r\\nhurricanes,  irreparable  damage  to  the atmosphere, and all the\\r\\nusual things that environmentalists usually go on about.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But I\\'ve just had a report that  a  representative  of  Disaster\\r\\nArea  met  with  the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them\\r\\nall shot, so nothing now lies in the way of ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You know what I\\'m thinking?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think so,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Tell me what you think I\\'m thinking.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think you\\'re thinking it\\'s time we get off this ship.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think you\\'re right,\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think you\\'re right,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Quiet,\" said Ford and Zaphod, \"we\\'re thinking.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So this is it,\" said Arthur, \"we\\'re going to die.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I wish you\\'d stop saying that,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is worth repeating at this point the theories  that  Ford  had\\r\\ncome  up  with,  on  his  first  encounter  with human beings, to\\r\\naccount for their  peculiar  habit  of  continually  stating  and\\r\\nrestating  the  very  very  obvious,  as it \\'It\\'s a nice day,\" or\\r\\n\"You\\'re very tall,\" or \"So this is it, we\\'re going to die.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHis first theory was that if human beings didn\\'t keep  exercising\\r\\ntheir lips, their mouths probably seized up.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter a few months of observation he had come up  with  a  second\\r\\ntheory,  which  was this - \"If human beings don\\'t keep exercising\\r\\ntheir lips, their brains start working.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIn fact, this  second  theory  is  more  literally  true  of  the\\r\\nBelcebron people of Kakrafoon.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe  Belcebron  people  used  to  cause  great   resentment   and\\r\\ninsecurity  amongst  neighboring  races  by being one of the most\\r\\nenlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet  civilizations  in\\r\\nthe Galaxy.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs a  punishment  for  this  behaviour,  which  was  held  to  be\\r\\noffensively  self  righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal\\r\\ninflicted on  them  that  most  cruel  of  all  social  diseases,\\r\\ntelepathy.   Consequently,   in   order   to  prevent  themselves\\r\\nbroadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds  to\\r\\nanyone  within  a  five  mile  radius, they now have to talk very\\r\\nloudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and\\r\\npains,  the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon\\r\\nhad suddenly become.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnother method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play\\r\\nhost to a Disaster Area concert.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe timing of the concert was critical.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in  order\\r\\nto  hit  the  sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the\\r\\nclimax of the song to which it related, so that the light of  the\\r\\nsolar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ship had already been diving for several minutes by the  time\\r\\nthat   Ford  Prefect  had  completed  his  search  of  the  other\\r\\ncompartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe sun of Kakrafoon loomed  terrifyingly  large  on  the  vision\\r\\nscreen,  its  blazing  white  inferno  of  fusing hydrogen nuclei\\r\\ngrowing moment by moment as the ship plunged  onwards,  unheeding\\r\\nthe  thumping and banging of Zaphod\\'s hands on the control panel.\\r\\nArthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions  of  rabbits  on  a\\r\\nnight   road  who  think  that  the  best  way  of  dealing  with\\r\\napproaching headlights is to stare them out.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod span round, wild-eyed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ford,\" he said, \"how many escape capsules are there?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"None,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod gibbered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Did you count them?\" he yelled.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Twice,\" said Ford, \"did you manage to raise the  stage  crew  on\\r\\nthe radio?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah,\" said Zaphod, bitterly, \"I said there were a  whole  bunch\\r\\nof people on board, and they said to say `hi\\' to everybody.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord goggled.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Didn\\'t you tell them who we were?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yeah. They said it was a great  honour.  That  and  something\\r\\nabout a restaurant bill and my executors.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord pushed Arthur aside and  leaned  forward  over  the  control\\r\\nconsole.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Does none of this function?\" he said savagely.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"All overridden.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Smash the autopilot.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Find it first. Nothing connects.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThere was a moment\\'s cold silence.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur was stumbling round the back  of  the  cabin.  He  stopped\\r\\nsuddenly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Incidentally,\" he said, \"what does teleport mean?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnother moment passed.\\r\\n \\r\\nSlowly, the others turned to face him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Probably the wrong moment to ask,\" said  Arthur,  \"It\\'s  just  I\\r\\nremember  hearing  you  use the word a short while ago and I only\\r\\nbring it up because ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where,\" said Ford Prefect quietly, \"does it say teleport?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, just over here in fact,\" said Arthur, pointing at  a  dark\\r\\ncontrol  box  in  the  rear  of  the  cabin, \"Just under the word\\r\\n`emergency\\', above the word `system\\' and beside the  sign  saying\\r\\n`out of order\\'.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the pandemonium that instantly followed, the  only  action  to\\r\\nfollow  was  that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the\\r\\nsmall black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly\\r\\nat the single small black button set into it.\\r\\n \\r\\nA  six-foot  square  panel  slid  open  beside  it  revealing   a\\r\\ncompartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found\\r\\na new function in life as  an  electrician\\'s  junk  store.  Half-\\r\\nfinished  wiring  hung  from  the  ceiling, a jumble of abandoned\\r\\ncomponents lay strewn on the floor,  and  the  programming  panel\\r\\nlolled  out  of  the cavity in the wall into which it should have\\r\\nbeen secured.\\r\\n \\r\\nA junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting  the  shipyard  where\\r\\nthis  ship  was  being  constructed,  had demanded to know of the\\r\\nworks foreman  why  the  hell  they  were  fitting  an  extremely\\r\\nexpensive  teleport  into  a  ship  which  only had one important\\r\\njourney to make, and that unmanned.  The  foreman  had  explained\\r\\nthat  the  teleport  was available at a ten per cent discount and\\r\\nthe accountant  had  explained  that  this  was  immaterial;  the\\r\\nforeman  had  explained that it was the finest, most powerful and\\r\\nsophisticated teleport that money could buy  and  the  accountant\\r\\nhad  explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman\\r\\nhad explained that people would still need to enter and leave the\\r\\nship  and  the  accountant  had explained that the ship sported a\\r\\nperfectly serviceable door; the foreman had  explained  that  the\\r\\naccountant  could  go  and  boil  his head and the accountant had\\r\\nexplained to the foreman that the thing approaching  him  rapidly\\r\\nfrom  his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had\\r\\nbeen concluded, work  was  discontinued  on  the  teleport  which\\r\\nsubsequently  passed  unnoticed on the invoice as \"Sund. explns.\"\\r\\nat five times the price.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hell\\'s donkeys,\" muttered Zaphod as he  and  Ford  attempted  to\\r\\nsort through the tangle of wiring.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter a moment or so Ford told him to stand  back.  He  tossed  a\\r\\ncoin  into  the  teleport  and  jiggled  a  switch on the lolling\\r\\ncontrol panel. With  a  crackle  and  spit  of  light,  the  coin\\r\\nvanished.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That much of  it  works,\"  said  Ford,  \"however,  there  is  no\\r\\nguidance  system. A matter transference teleport without guidance\\r\\nprogramming could put you ... well, anywhere.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Who cares,\" said Zaphod, \"we go where we go.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And,\" said Ford, \"there is no autosystem. We  couldn\\'t  all  go.\\r\\nSomeone would have to stay and operate it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, Marvin kid,\" said Zaphod brightly, \"how you doing?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Very badly I suspect,\" muttered Marvin.\\r\\n \\r\\nA shortish while later,  the  concert  on  Kakrafoon  reached  an\\r\\nunexpected climax.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe black ship with its single morose  occupant  had  plunged  on\\r\\nschedule  into  the  nuclear  furnace  of  the sun. Massive solar\\r\\nflares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling\\r\\nand  in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had\\r\\nbeen coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation  of\\r\\nthe moment.\\r\\n \\r\\nMoments before the flare light  reached  Kakrafoon  the  pounding\\r\\ndesert  cracked  along  a  deep  faultline.  A  huge and hitherto\\r\\nundetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed\\r\\nto  the  surface  to be followed seconds later by the eruption of\\r\\nmillions of tons of boiling lava that  flowed  hundreds  of  feet\\r\\ninto the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and\\r\\nbelow the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side  of\\r\\nthe world and back again.\\r\\n \\r\\nThose - very few - who witnessed the  event  and  survived  swear\\r\\nthat  the  whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose\\r\\ninto the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself  over  and\\r\\nfell  back  down. At that precise moment the solar radiation from\\r\\nthe flares filtered through the clouds  of  vaporized  water  and\\r\\nstruck the ground.\\r\\n \\r\\nA year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert  was  thick\\r\\nwith  flowers.  The structure of the atmosphere around the planet\\r\\nwas subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly  in  the  summer,\\r\\nthe cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more\\r\\noften,  and  slowly  the  desert  world  of  Kakrafoon  became  a\\r\\nparadise.  Even  the  telepathic  power  with which the people of\\r\\nKakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the  force\\r\\nof the explosion.\\r\\n \\r\\nA spokesman for Disaster Area - the  one  who  had  had  all  the\\r\\nenvironmentalists  shot  - was later quoted as saying that it had\\r\\nbeen \"a good gig\".\\r\\n \\r\\nMany people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A  few\\r\\nsceptical  scientists  examined  the  records  of the events more\\r\\nclosely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a\\r\\nvast  artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a\\r\\nnearby region of space.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur woke up and instantly regretted it.  Hangovers  he\\'d  had,\\r\\nbut  never  anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big\\r\\none, this was the ultimate pits. Matter  transference  beams,  he\\r\\ndecided,  were  not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n \\r\\nBeing for the moment unwilling to  move  on  account  of  a  dull\\r\\nstomping  throb  he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought.\\r\\nThe  trouble  with  most  forms  of  transport,  he  thought,  is\\r\\nbasically  one of them not being worth all the bother. On Earth -\\r\\nwhen there had been an Earth, before it was  demolished  to  make\\r\\nway for a new hyperspace bypass - the problem had been with cars.\\r\\nThe disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky  slime\\r\\nfrom  out  of  the  ground where it had been safely hidden out of\\r\\nharm\\'s way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke  to\\r\\nfill  the  air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed\\r\\nto outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from\\r\\none place to another - particularly when the place you arrived at\\r\\nhad probably become, as a result of this,  very  similar  to  the\\r\\nplace  you  had  left,  i.e.  covered with tar, full of smoke and\\r\\nshort of fish.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd what about matter transference beams? Any form  of  transport\\r\\nwhich  involved  tearing  you  apart atom by atom, flinging those\\r\\natoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back  together\\r\\nagain  just  when  they were getting their first taste of freedom\\r\\nfor years had to be bad news.\\r\\n \\r\\nMany people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent  and  had\\r\\neven  gone  to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one\\r\\nthat used regularly to be chanted  by  huge  crowds  outside  the\\r\\nSirius   Cybernetics  Corporation  Teleport  Systems  factory  on\\r\\nHappi-Werld III:\\r\\n \\r\\nAldebaran\\'s great, OK,\\r\\n \\r\\nAlgol\\'s pretty neat,\\r\\n \\r\\nBetelgeuse\\'s pretty girls,\\r\\n \\r\\nWill knock you off your feet.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey\\'ll do anything you like,\\r\\n \\r\\nReal fast and then real slow,\\r\\n \\r\\nBut if you have to take me apart to get me there,\\r\\n \\r\\nThen I don\\'t want to go.\\r\\n \\r\\nSinging,\\r\\n \\r\\nTake me apart, take me apart,\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat a way to roam,\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd if you have to take me apart to get me there,\\r\\n \\r\\nI\\'d rather stay at home.\\r\\n \\r\\nSirius is paved with gold\\r\\n \\r\\nSo I\\'ve heard it said\\r\\n \\r\\nBy nuts who then go on to say\\r\\n \\r\\n\"See Tau before you\\'re dead.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nI\\'ll gladly take the high road\\r\\n \\r\\nOr even take the low,\\r\\n \\r\\nBut if you have to take me apart to get me there,\\r\\n \\r\\nThen I, for one, won\\'t go.\\r\\n \\r\\nSinging,\\r\\n \\r\\nTake me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head,\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd if you try to take me apart to get me there,\\r\\n \\r\\nI\\'ll stay right here in bed.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nI teleported home one night,\\r\\n \\r\\nWith Ron and Sid and Meg,\\r\\n \\r\\nRon stole Meggie\\'s heart away,\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd I got Sidney\\'s leg.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur felt the waves of pain  slowly  receding,  though  he  was\\r\\nstill aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood\\r\\nup.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?\" said Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur span round  and  wobbled  uncertainly.  Ford  Prefect  was\\r\\napproaching looking red eyed and pasty.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where are we?\" gasped Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor\\r\\nwhich  stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel\\r\\nwall - which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which\\r\\nthey  use  in  schools,  hospitals and mental asylums to keep the\\r\\ninmates subdued - curved over the tops of their  heads  where  it\\r\\nmet  the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered\\r\\nin dark brown hessian wall weave. The floor  was  of  dark  green\\r\\nribbed rubber.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the\\r\\nouter  wall.  It was several layers deep, yet through it he could\\r\\nsee pinpoints of distant stars.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think we\\'re in a spaceship of some kind,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nDown the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Trillian?\" called Arthur nervously, \"Zaphod?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord shrugged.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nowhere about,\" he said, \"I\\'ve looked. They could  be  anywhere.\\r\\nAn  unprogrammed  teleport  can  throw  you  light  years  in any\\r\\ndirection. Judging by  the  way  I  feel  I  should  think  we\\'ve\\r\\ntravelled a very long way indeed.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How do you feel?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Bad.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do you think they\\'re ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where they are, how they are, there\\'s no way we can know and  no\\r\\nway we can do anything about it. Do what I do.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Don\\'t think about it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw  the\\r\\nwisdom  of  it,  tucked  it  up  and  put it away. He took a deep\\r\\nbreath.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Footsteps!\" exclaimed Ford suddenly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from\\r\\nan  indeterminate  distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding\\r\\nfootsteps, and it was noticeably louder.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Let\\'s move,\" said Ford sharply. They both moved  -  in  opposite\\r\\ndirections.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Not that way,\" said Ford, \"that\\'s where they\\'re coming from.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No it\\'s not,\" said Arthur, \"They\\'re coming from that way.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They\\'re not, they\\'re ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently.\\r\\nThey both agreed with each other. They both set off into opposite\\r\\ndirections again.\\r\\n \\r\\nFear gripped them.\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom both directions the noise was getting louder.\\r\\n \\r\\nA few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to\\r\\nthe inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark,\\r\\nimmensely long and,  as  they  passed  down  it,  gave  them  the\\r\\nimpression that it was getting colder and colder. Other corridors\\r\\ngave off it to the left  and  right,  each  very  dark  and  each\\r\\nsubjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor\\r\\nthey went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey pressed themselves back against the cold wall  and  listened\\r\\nfuriously.  The  cold,  the  dark and the drumming of disembodied\\r\\nfeet was getting to them badly. Ford shivered,  partly  with  the\\r\\ncold,  but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother\\r\\nused to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle\\r\\nhigh  to  an  Arcturan  Megagrasshopper:  stories  of dead ships,\\r\\nhaunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the  obscurer  regions\\r\\nof  deep  space  infested  with demons or the ghosts of forgotten\\r\\ncrews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered\\r\\nsuch  ships;  stories  of  ...  -  then Ford remembered the brown\\r\\nhessian wall weave in  the  first  corridor  and  pulled  himself\\r\\ntogether.  However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their\\r\\ndeath hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay  any  money  you\\r\\nliked it wasn\\'t with hessian wall weave. He grasped Arthur by the\\r\\narm.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Back the way we came,\"  he  said  firmly  and  they  started  to\\r\\nretrace their steps.\\r\\n \\r\\nA moment later they leap like startled lizards down  the  nearest\\r\\ncorridor  junction  as  the  owners of the drumming feet suddenly\\r\\nhove into view directly in front of them.\\r\\n \\r\\nHidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as  about  two\\r\\ndozen  overweight  men and women pounded past them in track suits\\r\\npanting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart  surgeon\\r\\ngibber.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord Prefect stared after them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Joggers!\" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed  away  up\\r\\nand down the network of corridors.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Joggers?\" whispered Arthur Dent.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Joggers,\" said Ford prefect with a shrug.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe corridor they were concealed in was not like the  others.  It\\r\\nwas  very  short,  and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined\\r\\nit, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe first thing that hit their eyes was what  appeared  to  be  a\\r\\ncoffin.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd the next four thousand nine hundred  and  ninety-nine  things\\r\\nthat hit their eyes were also coffins.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n \\r\\nThe vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At  the  far\\r\\nend,  about  three  hundred  yards away an archway let through to\\r\\nwhat appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on  to  the\\r\\nfloor of the vault.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Wild,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s so great about  dead  people?\"  asked  Arthur,  nervously\\r\\nstepping down after him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Dunno,\" said Ford, \"Let\\'s find out shall we?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nOn  closer  inspection  the  coffins  seemed  to  be  more   like\\r\\nsarcophagi.  They  stood about waist high and were constructed of\\r\\nwhat appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly  what\\r\\nit  was  -  something  that only appeared to be white marble. The\\r\\ntops were semi-translucent,  and  through  them  could  dimly  be\\r\\nperceived  the  features  of  their  late and presumably lamented\\r\\noccupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the  troubles\\r\\nof  whatever  world  it  was  they came from far behind them, but\\r\\nbeyond that little else could be discerned.\\r\\n \\r\\nRolling slowly round the  floor  between  the  sarcophagi  was  a\\r\\nheavy,  oily  white  gas  which  Arthur at first thought might be\\r\\nthere to give the place a little atmosphere until  he  discovered\\r\\nthat  it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely\\r\\ncold to the touch.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord suddenly crouched down beside  one  of  them.  He  pulled  a\\r\\ncorner  of  his  towel  out  of  his  satchel  and started to rub\\r\\nfuriously at something.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look, there\\'s a plaque on this one,\"  he  explained  to  Arthur,\\r\\n\"It\\'s frosted over.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe rubbed the frost clear and examined the  engraved  characters.\\r\\nTo  Arthur  they  looked like the footprints of a spider that had\\r\\nhad one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on  a  night\\r\\nout,  but  Ford  instantly  recognized  an early form of Galactic\\r\\nEezeereed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It says `Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven,  Telephone\\r\\nSanitizer Second Class\\' - and a serial number.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A  telephone  sanitizer?\"  said  Arthur,   \"a   dead   telephone\\r\\nsanitizer?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Best kind.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But what\\'s he doing here?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord peered through the top at the figure within.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Not a lot,\" he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins  of\\r\\nhis  which  always  made  people think he\\'d been overdoing things\\r\\nrecently and should try to get some rest.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment\\'s brisk  towel\\r\\nwork and he announced:\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This one\\'s a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place\\r\\nof an advertising account executive; the one after that contained\\r\\na second-hand car salesman, third class.\\r\\n \\r\\nAn inspection hatch let into the  floor  suddenly  caught  Ford\\'s\\r\\nattention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at\\r\\nthe clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him.\\r\\n \\r\\nA thought occurred to Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If these are just coffins,\" he  said,  \"Why  are  they  kept  so\\r\\ncold?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway,\"  said  Ford  tugging  the\\r\\nhatchway  open.  The  gas poured down through it. \"Why in fact is\\r\\nanyone going to all the  trouble  and  expense  of  carting  five\\r\\nthousand dead bodies through space?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ten thousand,\" said Arthur,  pointing  at  the  archway  through\\r\\nwhich the next chamber was dimly visible.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Fifteen thousand,\" he said, \"there\\'s another lot down there.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Fifteen million,\" said a voice.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s a lot,\" said Ford, \"A lot a lot.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Turn around slowly,\" barked the voice, \"and put your  hands  up.\\r\\nAny other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello?\" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting  his  hands  up\\r\\nand not making any other move.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why,\" said Arthur Dent, \"isn\\'t anyone ever pleased to see us?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nStanding silhouetted  in  the  doorway  through  which  they  had\\r\\nentered the vault was the man who wasn\\'t pleased to see them. His\\r\\ndispleasure was communicated  partly  by  the  barking  hectoring\\r\\nquality  of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he\\r\\nwaved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer  of  the\\r\\ngun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. \"Make\\r\\nit evil,\" he\\'d been told. \"Make it totally clear  that  this  gun\\r\\nhas  a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone\\r\\nstanding at the wrong end that things are going badly  for  them.\\r\\nIf  that  means  sticking  all  sort  of  spikes  and  prongs and\\r\\nblackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a  gun  for\\r\\nhanging  over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it\\r\\nis a gun for going out and making people miserable with.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man with the gun moved from the door and circled round  them.\\r\\nAs  he  came  into  the  light  they could see his black and gold\\r\\nuniform on which the buttons were so highly  polished  that  they\\r\\nshone  with  an  intensity  that  would  have made an approaching\\r\\nmotorist flash his lights in annoyance.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe gestured at the door.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Out,\" he said. People who can supply that amount of  fire  power\\r\\ndon\\'t  need  to  supply  verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out,\\r\\nclosely followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun  and  the\\r\\nbuttons.\\r\\n \\r\\nTurning into  the  corridor  they  were  jostled  by  twenty-four\\r\\noncoming  joggers,  now  showered  and changed, who swept on past\\r\\nthem into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Move!\" screamed their captor.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur moved.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord shrugged and moved.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the vault the joggers went  to  twenty-four  empty  sarcophagi\\r\\nalong  the  side  wall,  opened  them,  climbed in, and fell into\\r\\ntwenty-four dreamless sleeps.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, captain ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, Number One?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, dear.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHigh up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain  stared  out  into\\r\\nthe infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he\\r\\nreclined beneath a wide domed bubble  he  could  see  before  and\\r\\nabove  them  the  vast  panorama of stars through which they were\\r\\nmoving - a panorama that had thinned  out  noticably  during  the\\r\\ncourse  of  the  voyage.  Turning and looking backwards, over the\\r\\nvast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far  denser  mass\\r\\nof  stars  behind  them which seemed to form almost a solid band.\\r\\nThis was the view through the Galactic  centre  from  which  they\\r\\nwere  travelling,  and indeed had been travelling for years, at a\\r\\nspeed that he couldn\\'t quite remember at the moment, but he  knew\\r\\nit  was  terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of\\r\\nsomething or other, or was it three times the speed of  something\\r\\nelse? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into the bright distance\\r\\nbehind the ship, looking for something. He  did  this  every  few\\r\\nminutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn\\'t\\r\\nlet it worry him  though.  The  scientist  chaps  had  been  very\\r\\ninsistent  that  everything  was  going  to  be perfectly alright\\r\\nproviding nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their  bit\\r\\nin an orderly fashion.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe wasn\\'t panicking. As far as he was  concerned  everything  was\\r\\ngoing  splendidly.  He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy\\r\\nsponge. It crept back into his mind that he  was  feeling  mildly\\r\\nirritated  about something. Now what was all that about? A slight\\r\\ncough alerted him to the fact that the ship\\'s first  officer  was\\r\\nstill standing nearby.\\r\\n \\r\\nNice chap, Number One. Not of the very  brightest,  had  the  odd\\r\\nspot  of  difficulty  doing  up  his  shoe  laces, but jolly good\\r\\nofficer material for all that. The Captain wasn\\'t a man to kick a\\r\\nchap  when  he  was  bending over trying to do up his shoe laces,\\r\\nhowever long it took him.  Not  like  that  ghastly  Number  Two,\\r\\nstrutting  about  all  over  the  place,  polishing  his buttons,\\r\\nissuing reports  every  hour:  \"Ship\\'s  still  moving,  Captain.\"\\r\\n\"Still   on   course,   Captain.\"   \"Oxygen  levels  still  being\\r\\nmaintained, Captain.\" \"Give it a miss,\" was the  Captain\\'s  vote.\\r\\nAh  yes,  that  was  the  thing  that had been irritating him. He\\r\\npeered down at Number One.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or  other  about  having\\r\\nfound some prisoners ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty  unlikely  to  him,\\r\\nbut he wasn\\'t one to stand in his officers\\' way.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, perhaps that\\'ll keep him happy for a bit,\" he said,  \"He\\'s\\r\\nalways wanted some.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord Prefect and  Arthur  Dent  trudged  onwards  up  the  ship\\'s\\r\\napparently  endless  corridors.  Number  Two  marched behind them\\r\\nbarking the occasional order about not making any false moves  or\\r\\ntrying  any  funny  stuff.  They seemed to have passed at least a\\r\\nmile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached\\r\\na large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey entered.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most  remarkable\\r\\nthing  about  the  ship\\'s  bridge was not the fifty foot diameter\\r\\nhemispherical dome  which  covered  it,  and  through  which  the\\r\\ndazzling  display of stars shone down on them: to people who have\\r\\neaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such  wonders\\r\\nare  commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments\\r\\nthat crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur\\r\\nthis  was  exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to\\r\\nlook like, and  to  Ford  it  looked  thoroughly  antiquated:  it\\r\\nconfirmed his suspicions that Disaster Area\\'s stuntship had taken\\r\\nthem back at least a million, if not two  million,  years  before\\r\\ntheir own time.\\r\\n \\r\\nNo, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough  hewn  blue  water\\r\\ncrystal  and  was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside\\r\\nthe Maximegalon Museum  of  Diseased  Imaginings.  An  intestinal\\r\\njumble  of  plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than\\r\\ndecently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave;  the  taps  and\\r\\nshower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was  terribly\\r\\nwrong,  and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this\\r\\nthat Number Two approached it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Captain, sir!\" he shouted through clenched teeth -  a  difficult\\r\\ntrick but he\\'d had years during which to perfect it.\\r\\n \\r\\nA large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above\\r\\nthe rim of the monstrous bath.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, hello, Number  Two,\"  said  the  Captain,  waving  a  cheery\\r\\nsponge, \"having a nice day?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nNumber Two snapped even further to attention than he already was.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven,\\r\\nsir!\" he yapped.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord and Arthur coughed in confusion.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er ... hello,\" they said.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really  found  some\\r\\nprisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a\\r\\nchap doing what he\\'s best at.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, hello there,\" he said to them, \"Excuse me  not  getting  up,\\r\\nhaving  a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in\\r\\nthe fridge Number one.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Certainly sir.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is a curious fact, and one to which no  one  knows  quite  how\\r\\nmuch  importance  to attach, that something like 85% of all known\\r\\nworlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced,  have\\r\\ninvented  a  drink  called  jynnan  tonnyx, or gee-N\\'N-T\\'N-ix, or\\r\\njinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or  more  variations  on\\r\\nthe  same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same,\\r\\nand vary between the Sivolvian \"chinanto/mnigs\" which is ordinary\\r\\nwater   server  at  slightly  above  room  temperature,  and  the\\r\\nGagrakackan \"tzjin-anthony-ks\" which  kills  cows  at  a  hundred\\r\\npaces;  and  in  fact  the one common factor between all of them,\\r\\nbeyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they  were\\r\\nall  invented  and named before the worlds concerned made contact\\r\\nwith any other worlds.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat can be made of this fact? It exists in total  isolation.  As\\r\\nfar  as  any  theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is\\r\\nright  off  the  graph,  and  yet  it  persists.  Old  structural\\r\\nlinguists  get  very  angry when young structural linguists go on\\r\\nabout it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about  it\\r\\nand  stay  up late at night convinced that they are very close to\\r\\nsomething  of  profound  importance,  and  end  up  becoming  old\\r\\nstructural  linguists  before their time, getting very angry with\\r\\nthe young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided  and\\r\\nunhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend\\r\\ntoo many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs.\\r\\n \\r\\nNumber Two stood before  the  Captain\\'s  bathtub  trembling  with\\r\\nfrustration.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Don\\'t you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?\" he squealed.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain peered at him in bemusement.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?\" he asked.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why  they  came\\r\\nhere!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh no, no, no,\" said the Captain, \"I expect they just dropped in\\r\\nfor a quick jynnan tonnyx, don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But sir, they\\'re my prisoners! I must interrogate them!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain looked at them doubtfully.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh all right,\" he said, \"if you must. Ask them what they want to\\r\\ndrink.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA hard cold gleam came into Number Two\\'s eyes. He advanced slowly\\r\\non Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"All right, you scum,\" he growled, \"you  vermin  ...\"  He  jabbed\\r\\nFord with the Kill-O-Zap gun.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Steady on, Number Two,\" admonished the Captain gently.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What do you want to drink!!!\" Number Two screamed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me,\" said Ford, \"What\\r\\nabout you Arthur?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur blinked.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What? Oh, er, yes,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"With ice or without?\" bellowed Number Two.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, with please,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Lemon??!!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes please,\" said Ford, \"and do you have  any  of  those  little\\r\\nbiscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m asking  the  questions!!!!\"  howled  Number  Two,  his  body\\r\\nquaking with apoplectic fury.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, Number Two ...\" said the Captain softly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Sir?!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Push off, would you, there\\'s a good chap. I\\'m trying to  have  a\\r\\nrelaxing bath.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nNumber Two\\'s eyes narrowed and  became  what  are  known  in  the\\r\\nShouting  and  Killing  People  trade  as  cold  slits,  the idea\\r\\npresumably being to give your opponent the  impression  that  you\\r\\nhave  lost  your  glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake.\\r\\nWhy this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe advanced on the captain, his (Number Two\\'s) mouth a thin  hard\\r\\nline.  Again,  tricky  to know why this is understood as fighting\\r\\nbehaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal,  you\\r\\nwere  suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast,\\r\\nyou would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard\\r\\nline  rather  than,  as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering\\r\\nfangs.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"May I remind you sir,\" hissed Number Two at the  Captain,  \"that\\r\\nyou have now been in that bath for over three years?!\" This final\\r\\nshot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to  a\\r\\ncorner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave  Ford  Prefect  a  lame\\r\\nsmile.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord slowly lowered his hands. It provoked  no  reaction.  Arthur\\r\\nlowered his.\\r\\n \\r\\nTreading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to  the  bath\\r\\npedestal. He patted it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Nice,\" he lied.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he\\r\\ngrinned. It was safe.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er ...\" he said to the Captain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes?\" said the Captain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I wonder,\" said Ford, \"could I ask you actually what your job is\\r\\nin fact?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was the first officer.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Your drinks,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, thank you,\" said Ford.  He  and  Arthur  took  their  jynnan\\r\\ntonnyx.  Arthur  sipped  his,  and  was  surprised to discover it\\r\\ntasted very like a whisky and soda.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I mean, I couldn\\'t help noticing,\" said Ford, also taking a sip,\\r\\n\"the bodies. In the hold.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Bodies?\" said the Captain in surprise.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord paused and thought  to  himself.  Never  take  anything  for\\r\\ngranted,  he  thought.  Could it be that the Captain doesn\\'t know\\r\\nhe\\'s got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship?\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be\\r\\nplaying with a rubber duck.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the  mirror,\\r\\nbut  only  for  an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move.\\r\\nThe first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray\\r\\nand smiling benignly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Bodies?\" said the Captain again.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord licked his lips.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"All those dead telephone sanitizers and  account\\r\\nexecutives, you know, down in the hold.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back  his  head  and\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh they\\'re not dead,\" he said, \"Good Lord no, no they\\'re frozen.\\r\\nThey\\'re going to be revived.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord did something he very rarely did. He blinked.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur seemed to come out of a trance.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean you\\'ve got a hold  full  of  frozen  hairdressers?\"  he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes,\" said the  Captain,  \"Millions  of  them.  Hairdressers,\\r\\ntired  TV  producers,  insurance  salesmen,  personnel  officers,\\r\\nsecurity  guards,   public   relations   executives,   management\\r\\nconsultants,  you  name  them.  We\\'re  going  to colonize another\\r\\nplanet.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord wobbled very slightly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Exciting isn\\'t it?\" said the Captain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What, with that lot?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, now don\\'t misunderstand me,\" said the Captain,  \"we\\'re  just\\r\\none  of  the  ships  in the Ark Fleet. We\\'re the `B\\' Ark you see.\\r\\nSorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around\\r\\nthe bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do  help  yourselves  to  more\\r\\ndrinks of course.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord tossed down his  drink,  took  the  bottle  from  the  first\\r\\nofficer\\'s tray and refilled his glass to the top.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What,\" he said, \"is a `B\\' Ark?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This is,\" said the Captain, and swished the foamy  water  around\\r\\njoyfully with the duck.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Ford, \"but ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well what happened you see was,\" said the Captain, \"our  planet,\\r\\nthe world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Doomed?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes. So what everyone  thought  was,  let\\'s  pack  the  whole\\r\\npopulation  into  some  giant  spaceships  and  go  and settle on\\r\\nanother planet.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHaving told this much of  his  story,  he  settled  back  with  a\\r\\nsatisfied grunt.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean a less doomed one?\" promoted Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What did you say dear fellow?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided  to  build  three\\r\\nships,  you  see, three Arks in Space, and ... I\\'m not boring you\\r\\nam I?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, no,\" said Ford firmly, \"it\\'s fascinating.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You know it\\'s  delightful,\"  reflected  the  Captain,  \"to  have\\r\\nsomeone else to talk to for a change.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nNumber Two\\'s eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then\\r\\nsettled  back  on  the  mirror,  like  a  pair  of  flies briefly\\r\\ndistracted from their favourite prey of months old meat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Trouble with a long journey like this,\" continued  the  Captain,\\r\\n\"is  that  you  end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets\\r\\nterribly boring because half the time you know what you\\'re  going\\r\\nto say next.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Only half the time?\" asked Arthur in surprise.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain thought for a moment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, about half I\\'d say. Anyway - where\\'s the soap?\"  He  fished\\r\\naround and found it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, so anyway,\" he resumed, \"the idea was that into  the  first\\r\\nship,  the  `A\\'  ship,  would  go  all the brilliant leaders, the\\r\\nscientists, the great artists, you know, all the  achievers;  and\\r\\ninto  the third, or `C\\' ship, would go all the people who did the\\r\\nactual work, who made things and did things, and  then  into  the\\r\\n`B\\'  ship - that\\'s us - would go everyone else, the middlemen you\\r\\nsee.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe smiled happily at them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And we were sent off first,\" he concluded, and hummed  a  little\\r\\nbathing tune.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe little bathing tune, which had been composed for him  by  one\\r\\nof  his world\\'s most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was\\r\\ncurrently asleep in  hold  thirty-six  some  nine  hundred  yards\\r\\nbehind  them)  covered  what would otherwise have been an awkward\\r\\nmoment of silence.  Ford  and  Arthur  shuffled  their  feet  and\\r\\nfuriously avoided each other\\'s eyes.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er ...\" said Arthur after a moment, \"what exactly  was  it  that\\r\\nwas wrong with your planet then?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, it was doomed, as I said,\" said the Captain, \"Apparently  it\\r\\nwas  going  to  crash  into the sun or something. Or maybe it was\\r\\nthat the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the  kind.\\r\\nAbsolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh,\" said the first officer suddenly, \"I thought it was that the\\r\\nplanet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot\\r\\npiranha bees. Wasn\\'t that it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nNumber Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard  light  that\\r\\nonly comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s not what I was told!\" he hissed, \"My  commanding  officer\\r\\ntold  me  that  the entire planet was in imminent danger of being\\r\\neaten by an enormous mutant star goat!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh really ...\" said Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit  of  hell  with  scything\\r\\nteeth  ten  thousand  miles  long, breath that would boil oceans,\\r\\nclaws that could tear continents from  their  roots,  a  thousand\\r\\neyes  that  burned  like  the sun, slavering jaws a million miles\\r\\nacross, a monster such as you have never ... never ... ever ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And they made sure they  sent  you  lot  off  first  did  they?\"\\r\\ninquired Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes,\" said the Captain, \"well everyone said,  very  nicely  I\\r\\nthought,  that it was very important for morale to feel that they\\r\\nwould be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a  good\\r\\nhaircut and where the phones were clean.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes,\" agreed Ford, \"I can see that would be  very  important.\\r\\nAnd the other ships, er ... they followed on after you did they?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFor a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in  his\\r\\nbath  and  gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards\\r\\nthe bright galactic centre. He squinted  into  the  inconceivable\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah. Well it\\'s funny you should say that,\" he  said  and  allowed\\r\\nhimself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, \"because curiously enough\\r\\nwe haven\\'t heard a peep out of them since we left five years  ago\\r\\n... but they must be behind us somewhere.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe peered off into the distance again.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Unless of course,\" he said softly, \"they were eaten by the  goat\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah yes ...\" said the Captain with a  slight  hesitancy  creeping\\r\\ninto  his  voice,  \"the  goat ...\" His eyes passed over the solid\\r\\nshapes of the instruments and computers that  lined  the  bridge.\\r\\nThey  winked  away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars,\\r\\nbut none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and  second\\r\\nofficers,  but  they  seemed  lost  in  their  own thoughts for a\\r\\nmoment. He glanced at Ford Prefect who  raised  his  eyebrows  at\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s a funny thing you know,\" said the Captain at last, \"but now\\r\\nthat I actually come to tell the story to someone else ... I mean\\r\\ndoes it strike you as odd Number Two?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Errrrrrrrrrrr ...\" said Number Two.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" said Ford, \"I can see that you\\'ve got  a  lot  of  things\\r\\nyou\\'re going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you\\r\\ncould sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, well that\\'s a little difficult you see,\" said  the  Captain,\\r\\n\"because   our  trajectory  thingy  was  preset  before  we  left\\r\\nGolgafrincham, I think partly because  I\\'m  not  very  good  with\\r\\nfigures ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean we\\'re stuck here on this ship?\" exclaimed Ford suddenly\\r\\nlosing patience with the whole charade, \"When are you meant to be\\r\\nreaching this planet you\\'re meant to be colonizing?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, we\\'re nearly there I think,\" said the Captain,  \"any  second\\r\\nnow.  It\\'s  probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact.\\r\\nOh, I don\\'t know though, why stop just when I\\'m enjoying it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So we\\'re actually going to land in a minute?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land  as  such,  no\\r\\n... er ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Ford sharply.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Captain,  picking  his  way  through  the  words\\r\\ncarefully,  \"I  think as far as I can remember we were programmed\\r\\nto crash on it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Crash?\" shouted Ford and Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, yes,\" said the Captain, \"yes, it\\'s all part of  the  plan  I\\r\\nthink.  There  was  a  terribly  good reason for it which I can\\'t\\r\\nquite remember at the moment. It was something  to  with  ...  er\\r\\n...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord exploded.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re a load of useless bloody loonies!\" he shouted.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah yes, that was it,\" beamed the Captain, \"that was the reason.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy has this to say  about  the\\r\\nplanet  of  Golgafrincham:  It  is  a  planet with an ancient and\\r\\nmysterious history, rich in legend, red, and  occasionally  green\\r\\nwith  the  blood  of those who sought in times gone by to conquer\\r\\nher; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry\\r\\nair  heady  with  the  scent of the perfumed springs that trickle\\r\\nover its hot and dusty rocks  and  nourish  the  dark  and  musty\\r\\nlichens   beneath;  a  land  of  fevered  brows  and  intoxicated\\r\\nimaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the  lichens;  a\\r\\nland  also  of  cool  and  shaded thoughts amongst those who have\\r\\nlearnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath;  a\\r\\nland  also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and\\r\\nof the spirit. This was its history.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd  in  all  this  ancient  and  mysterious  history,  the  most\\r\\nmysterious  figures  of all were without doubt those of the Great\\r\\nCircling Poets of Arium. These Circling Poets  used  to  live  in\\r\\nremote  mountain  passes  where  they would lie in wait for small\\r\\nbands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd when the travellers cried out, saying why didn\\'t they go away\\r\\nand  get  on  with writing some poems instead of pestering people\\r\\nwith all this rock-throwing business, they would  suddenly  stop,\\r\\nand  then  break  into  one  of the seven hundred and ninety-four\\r\\ngreat  Song  Cycles  of  Vassilian.  These  songs  were  all   of\\r\\nextraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all\\r\\nfell into exactly the same pattern.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe first part of each song would tell how there once went  forth\\r\\nfrom the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four\\r\\nhorses. The princes, who are of course  brave,  noble  and  wise,\\r\\ntravel widely in distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic\\r\\nphilosophies, take tea  with  weird  gods  and  rescue  beautiful\\r\\nmonsters  from ravening princesses before finally announcing that\\r\\nthey have achieved enlightenment and that  their  wanderings  are\\r\\ntherefore accomplished.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of\\r\\nall  their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to\\r\\nwalk back.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll this lay in the planet\\'s remote  past.  It  was,  however,  a\\r\\ndescendant  of  one  of  these  eccentric  poets who invented the\\r\\nspurious tales of impending doom  which  enabled  the  people  of\\r\\nGolgafrincham  to  rid  themselves  of an entire useless third of\\r\\ntheir population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home  and\\r\\nlived  full,  rich  and  happy lives until they were all suddenly\\r\\nwiped  out  by  a  virulent  disease  contracted  from  a   dirty\\r\\ntelephone.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n \\r\\nThat night the ship crash-landed on to an  utterly  insignificant\\r\\nlittle  green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow\\r\\nsun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end  of  the\\r\\nWestern spiral arm of the Galaxy.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn  the  hours  preceding  the  crash  Ford  Prefect  had  fought\\r\\nfuriously  but  in  vain  to unlock the controls of the ship from\\r\\ntheir pre-ordained flight path. It had quickly become apparent to\\r\\nhim  that  the  ship  had  been  programmed to convey its payload\\r\\nsafely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to  cripple  itself\\r\\nbeyond repair in the process.\\r\\n \\r\\nIts  screaming,  blazing  descent  through  the  atmosphere   had\\r\\nstripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and\\r\\nits final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp  had  left  its\\r\\ncrew  only  a  few  hours  of darkness during which to revive and\\r\\noffload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began  to\\r\\nsettle  almost  at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the\\r\\nstagnant slime. Once or twice during the  night  it  was  starkly\\r\\nsilhouetted  against the sky as burning meteors - the detritus of\\r\\nits descent - flashed across the sky.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene  roaring  gurgle\\r\\nand sank for ever into the stinking depths.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen the sun came up that morning it shed its thin  watery  light\\r\\nover  a  vast  area  heaving  with  wailing  hairdressers, public\\r\\nrelations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing\\r\\ntheir way desperately to dry land.\\r\\n \\r\\nA less strong minded sun would probably have gone  straight  back\\r\\ndown again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and\\r\\nafter a while the influence of its warming  rays  began  to  have\\r\\nsome restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures.\\r\\n \\r\\nCountless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp  in\\r\\nthe  night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship,\\r\\nbut those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands  and\\r\\nas  the  day  wore  on  they  crawled  out  over  the surrounding\\r\\ncountryside, each looking for a few square feet of  solid  ground\\r\\non which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal.\\r\\n \\r\\nTwo figures moved further afield.\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent  watched  the\\r\\nhorror of which they could not feel a part.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Filthy dirty trick to pull,\" muttered Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"An imaginative solution to a problem I\\'d have thought,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why can\\'t people just  learn  to  live  together  in  peace  and\\r\\nharmony?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord gave a loud, very hollow laugh.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Forty-two!\" he said with a malicious grin,  \"No,  doesn\\'t  work.\\r\\nNever mind.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur looked at him as if he\\'d gone mad and, seeing  nothing  to\\r\\nindicate  the  contrary,  realized  that  it  would  be perfectly\\r\\nreasonable to assume that this had in fact happened.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What do you think will happen to them  all?\"  he  said  after  a\\r\\nwhile.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"In an infinite Universe anything can happen,\" said  Ford,  \"Even\\r\\nsurvival. Strange but true.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA curious look came  into  his  eyes  as  they  passed  over  the\\r\\nlandscape  and  then  settles  again on the scene of misery below\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think they\\'ll manage for a while,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur looked up sharply.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why do you say that?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord shrugged.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Just a hunch,\" he said, and refused to be drawn to  any  further\\r\\nquestions.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look,\" he said suddenly.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst  the  sprawling\\r\\nmasses  a figure was moving - or perhaps lurching would be a more\\r\\naccurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his\\r\\nshoulder.  As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he\\r\\nseemed to wave whatever the something was at them  in  a  drunken\\r\\nfashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a\\r\\nheap.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Movie camera,\" said Ford. \"Recording the historic movement.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know about you,\" said Ford again after  a  moment,\\r\\n\"but I\\'m off.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe sat a while in silence.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter a while this seemed to require comment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, when you say you\\'re off, what do  you  mean  exactly?\"  said\\r\\nArthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good question,\" said Ford, \"I\\'m getting total silence.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nLooking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was  twiddling  with\\r\\nknobs  on  a small box. Ford had already introduced this box as a\\r\\nSub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently  and\\r\\nnot  pursued  the  matter. In his mind the Universe still divided\\r\\ninto two parts - the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having\\r\\nbeen  demolished  to  make  way for a new hyperspace bypass meant\\r\\nthat this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended\\r\\nto cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact\\r\\nwith his home. Sub-Etha  Sens-O-Matics  belonged  firmly  in  the\\r\\n\"everything else\" category.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Not a sausage,\" said Ford, shaking the thing.\\r\\n \\r\\nSausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at  the\\r\\nprimitive  world about him, what I wouldn\\'t give for a good Earth\\r\\nsausage.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Would you believe,\" said Ford in exasperation, \"that  there  are\\r\\nno transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted\\r\\ntip? Are you listening to me?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We\\'re in trouble,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Until we pick up anything on  this  machine,\"  said  Ford,  \"our\\r\\nchances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak\\r\\nstanding wave effect in the planet\\'s magnetic field  -  in  which\\r\\ncase  we  just  travel  round  and  round  till  we  find a clear\\r\\nreception area. Coming?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe picked up his gear and strode off.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur looked down the hill. The man with the  movie  camera  had\\r\\nstruggled  back  up  to  his feet just in time to film one of his\\r\\ncolleagues collapsing.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I trust you had a pleasant meal?\" said Zarniwoop to  Zaphod  and\\r\\nTrillian  as  they  rematerialized  on the bridge of the starship\\r\\nHeart of Gold and lay panting on the floor.\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You,\" he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to  find\\r\\na chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I  have  programmed  the   computer   with   the   Improbability\\r\\nCoordinates  pertinent  to our journey,\" said Zarniwoop, \"we will\\r\\narrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why  don\\'t  you  relax  and\\r\\nprepare yourself for the meeting?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a  small\\r\\ncabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit. He took\\r\\na long pull at it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And when this is all done,\" said Zaphod  savagely,  \"it\\'s  done,\\r\\nalright?  I\\'m  free  to go and do what the hell I like and lie on\\r\\nbeaches and stuff?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It depends what transpires from the meeting,\" said Zarniwoop.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Zaphod, who is this man?\" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her\\r\\nfeet, \"What\\'s he doing here? Why\\'s he on our ship?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"He\\'s a very stupid man,\" said Zaphod, \"who wants to meet the man\\r\\nwho rules the Universe.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Trillian taking the bottle  from  Zaphod  and  helping\\r\\nherself, \"a social climber.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n \\r\\nThe major problem - one of the  major  problems,  for  there  are\\r\\nseveral - one of the many major problems with governing people is\\r\\nthat of whom you get to do it; or rather of who  manages  to  get\\r\\npeople to let them do it to them.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most\\r\\nwant to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.\\r\\nTo summarize the  summary:  anyone  who  is  capable  of  getting\\r\\nthemselves  made  President should on no account be allowed to do\\r\\nthe job. To summarize the summary of the summary:  people  are  a\\r\\nproblem.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd so this is the situation we find: a  succession  of  Galactic\\r\\nPresidents  who  so  much  enjoy  the fun and palaver of being in\\r\\npower that they very rarely notice that they\\'re not.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd somewhere in the shadows behind them - who?\\r\\n \\r\\nWho can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed\\r\\nto?\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n \\r\\nOn a small obscure world somewhere in the middle  of  nowhere  in\\r\\nparticular - nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it\\r\\nis protected by a vast field of unprobability to which  only  six\\r\\nmen in this galaxy have a key - it was raining.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of\\r\\nthe sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped\\r\\na stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe rain pelted and danced on the corrugated  iron  roof  of  the\\r\\nsmall  shack  that  stood  in the middle of this patch of scrubby\\r\\nland. It obliterated the small rough pathway that  led  from  the\\r\\nshack  down  to  the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of\\r\\ninteresting shells which had been placed there.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe noise of the rain on the roof  of  the  shack  was  deafening\\r\\nwithin,  but  went  largely  unnoticed  by  its  occupant,  whose\\r\\nattention was otherwise engaged.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured  hair  that\\r\\nwas damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back\\r\\nwas hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn his shack was an old  beaten-up  armchair,  an  old  scratched\\r\\ntable,  an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small\\r\\nbut warm.\\r\\n \\r\\nThere was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten  cat,  and  this\\r\\nwas  currently  the  focus  of  the  man\\'s attention. He bent his\\r\\nshambling form over it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pussy, pussy, pussy,\" he said, \"coochicoochicoochicoo ...  pussy\\r\\nwant his fish? Nice piece of fish ... pussy want it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe  cat  seemed  undecided  on  the  matter.  It  pawed   rather\\r\\ncondescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and\\r\\nthen got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think,\"\\r\\nsaid the man. Doubt crept into his voice.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I imagine this is what will happen,\" he said,  \"but  how  can  I\\r\\ntell?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe proffered the fish again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pussy think,\" he said, \"eat fish or not eat fish. I think it  is\\r\\nbetter if I don\\'t get involved.\" He sighed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so  who\\r\\nam I to judge?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe left the fish on the floor for the cat,  and  retired  to  his\\r\\nseat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, I seem to see you eating it,\" he said at last,  as  the  cat\\r\\nexhausted  the  entertainment  possibilities of the speck of dust\\r\\nand pounced on to the fish.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I like it when I see you eat the fish,\" said the  man,  \"because\\r\\nin my mind you will waste away if you don\\'t.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe picked up from the table a piece of paper and the  stub  of  a\\r\\npencil.  He  held one in one hand and the other in the other, and\\r\\nexperimented with the different ways of bringing  them  together.\\r\\nHe tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper,\\r\\nthen next to the paper. He tried wrapping  the  paper  round  the\\r\\npencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the\\r\\npaper and then he tried rubbing  the  sharp  end  of  the  pencil\\r\\nagainst  the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the\\r\\ndiscovery, as he was every day. He picked  up  another  piece  of\\r\\npaper  from  the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it\\r\\nbriefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe tried sitting on one of his hands and  was  intrigued  by  the\\r\\nfeel of the bones of his hip.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Fish come from far away,\" he said, \"or so  I\\'m  told.  Or  so  I\\r\\nimagine  I\\'m  told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men\\r\\ncome in their six black ships, do they come  in  your  mind  too?\\r\\nWhat do you see pussy?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe looked at the cat, which was more concerned with  getting  the\\r\\nfish  down  as  rapidly  as  possible  than  it  was  with  these\\r\\nspeculations.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What  do\\r\\ntheir  voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they\\'re singing\\r\\nsongs to you.\" He reflected on this, and  saw  the  flaw  in  the\\r\\nsupposition.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Perhaps they are singing songs to you,\" he  said,  \"and  I  just\\r\\nthink they\\'re asking me questions.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just  to  see\\r\\nwhat it was like.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do you think they came today?\" he said, \"I do.  There\\'s  mud  on\\r\\nthe  floor,  cigarettes  and whisky on the table, fish on a plate\\r\\nfor you and a memory  of  them  in  my  mind.  Hardly  conclusive\\r\\nevidence  I  know,  but  then all evidence is circumstantial. And\\r\\nlook what else they\\'ve left me.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe reached over to the table and pulled some things off it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to\\r\\nsleep  and  the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put\\r\\nthe calculator aside.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me  questions,\"  he\\r\\nsaid,  \"To  come  all that way and leave all these things for the\\r\\nprivilege  of  singing  songs  to  you  would  be  very   strange\\r\\nbehaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell, who can tell.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with  a  spill\\r\\nfrom the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think I saw another ship in the sky today,\" he said  at  last.\\r\\n\"A  big  white one. I\\'ve never seen a big white one, just the six\\r\\nblack ones. And the six green ones. And the others who  say  they\\r\\ncome  from  so far away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small\\r\\nblack ones can look like one big  white  one  at  certain  times.\\r\\nPerhaps  I  would  like  a  glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more\\r\\nlikely.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by  the\\r\\nmattress.  He  poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nA hundred yards away, pelted by  the  torrential  rain,  lay  the\\r\\nHeart of Gold.\\r\\n \\r\\nIts hatchway opened, and three  figures  emerged,  huddling  into\\r\\nthemselves to keep the rain off their faces.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"In there?\" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Zarniwoop.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That shack?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Weird,\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But it\\'s in the middle of nowhere,\" said Trillian, \"we must have\\r\\ncome  to  the  wrong  place.  You  can\\'t rule the Universe from a\\r\\nshack.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet  through,\\r\\nat the door. They knocked. They shivered.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe door opened.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello?\" said the man.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, excuse me,\" said Zarniwoop, \"I have reason to believe ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do you rule the Universe?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man smiled at him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I try not to,\" he said, \"Are you wet?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod looked at him in astonishment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Wet?\" he cried, \"Doesn\\'t it look as if we\\'re wet?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s how it looks to me,\" said the  man,  \"but  how  you  feel\\r\\nabout  it  might  be  an altogether different matter. If you feel\\r\\nwarmth makes you dry, you\\'d better come in.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey went in.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey  looked  around  the  tiny  shack,  Zarniwoop  with   slight\\r\\ndistaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hey, er ...\" said Zaphod, \"what\\'s your name?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man looked at them doubtfully.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I don\\'t know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very\\r\\nodd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on  the  edge  of\\r\\nthe  chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod\\r\\nlay on the mattress.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Wowee!\" said Zaphod, \"the seat of power!\" He tickled the cat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Listen,\" said Zarniwoop, \"I must ask you some questions.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" said the man kindly, \"you can sing to my  cat  if  you\\r\\nlike.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Would he like that?\" asked Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'d better ask him,\" said the man.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Does he talk?\" said Zaphod.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I have no memory of him talking,\" said the man, \"but I  am  very\\r\\nunreliable.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Now,\" he said, \"you do rule the Universe, do you?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How can I tell?\" said the man.\\r\\n \\r\\nZarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How long have you been doing this?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" said the man, \"this is a question about the past is it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn\\'t  exactly  what\\r\\nhe had been expecting.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How can I tell,\" said the man, \"that the past  isn\\'t  a  fiction\\r\\ndesigned  to  account  for  the  discrepancy between my immediate\\r\\nphysical sensations and my state of mind?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his  sodden\\r\\nclothes.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So you answer all questions like this?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man answered quickly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say\\r\\nthings. More I cannot say.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZaphod laughed happily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'ll drink to that,\" he said and pulled out the bottle  of  Janx\\r\\nspirit.  He  leaped  up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the\\r\\nUniverse, who took it with pleasure.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good on you, great ruler,\" he said, \"tell it like it is.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, listen to me,\" said Zarniwoop, \"people come to you do  they?\\r\\nIn ships ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think so,\" said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And they ask you,\" said Zarniwoop, \"to take decisions for  them?\\r\\nAbout  people\\'s lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars,\\r\\nabout everything going on out there in the Universe?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Out there?\" said the man, \"out where?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Out there!\" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How can you tell there\\'s  anything  out  there,\"  said  the  man\\r\\npolitely, \"the door\\'s closed.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe rain continued to pound the roof. Inside  the  shack  it  was\\r\\nwarm.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But  you  know  there\\'s  a  whole  Universe  out  there!\"  cried\\r\\nZarniwoop.  \"You can\\'t dodge your responsibilities by saying they\\r\\ndon\\'t exist!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ruler of  the  Universe  thought  for  a  long  while  whilst\\r\\nZarniwoop quivered with anger.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re very sure of your facts,\" he said at  last,  \"I  couldn\\'t\\r\\ntrust  the thinking of a man who takes the Universe - if there is\\r\\none - for granted.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZarniwoop still quivered, but was silent.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I only decide about my Universe,\" continued the man quietly. \"My\\r\\nUniverse is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But don\\'t you believe in anything?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe man shrugged and picked up his cat.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I don\\'t understand what you mean,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You don\\'t understand that what you decide in this shack of yours\\r\\naffects  the  lives  and fates of millions of people? This is all\\r\\nmonstrously wrong!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve never met all these people you speak of.  And\\r\\nneither,  I  suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear.\\r\\nIt is folly to say you know what is happening  to  other  people.\\r\\nOnly  they  know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of\\r\\ntheir own eyes and ears.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nTrillian said:\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think I\\'m just popping outside for a moment.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nShe left and walked into the rain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do you believe other people exist?\" insisted Zarniwoop.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I have no opinion. How can I say?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'d better see what\\'s up with Trillian,\" said Zaphod and slipped\\r\\nout.\\r\\n \\r\\nOutside, he said to her:\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Very good,\" said Trillian. They walked off into the rain.\\r\\n \\r\\nInside, Zarniwoop continued.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But don\\'t you understand that people live or die on your word?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he\\r\\nheard  the faint sound of the ship\\'s engines starting he spoke to\\r\\ncover it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s nothing to do with me,\" he said, \"I am  not  involved  with\\r\\npeople. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah!\" barked Zarniwoop, \"you  say  `The  Lord\\'.  You  believe  in\\r\\nsomething!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"My cat,\" said the man benignly, picking it up and  stroking  it,\\r\\n\"I call him The Lord. I am kind to him.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, \"How  do  you\\r\\nknow  he  exists?  How  do  you  know he knows you to be kind, or\\r\\nenjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I don\\'t,\" said the man with a smile, \"I have no idea. It  merely\\r\\npleases  me  to  behave  in a certain way to what appears to be a\\r\\ncat. Do you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nZarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where are the other two?\" he said suddenly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What other two?\" said the ruler of the Universe,  settling  back\\r\\ninto his chair and refilling his whisky glass.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Stuff it,\" snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into  the  rain.  There\\r\\nwas  no  ship.  The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no\\r\\nsign to show where the ship had been. He hollered into the  rain.\\r\\nHe turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in  his  chair.  After  a\\r\\nwhile  he  played  with  the  pencil  and the paper again and was\\r\\ndelighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the  one  on\\r\\nthe  other.  Various noises continued outside, but he didn\\'t know\\r\\nwhether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for  a\\r\\nweek to see how it would react.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n \\r\\nThe stars came out that night, dazzling in their  brilliance  and\\r\\nclarity.  Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any\\r\\nmeans of judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was  cool\\r\\nand  balmy,  the  air  pure,  the  Sub-Etha  Sens.O.Matic totally\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n \\r\\nA wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical  calm  which\\r\\ncombined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter\\r\\nof insects and the brilliant light of the stars to  soothe  their\\r\\njangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than\\r\\nhe could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder  if  this\\r\\nwas  the  most  beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had\\r\\npassed through rolling green hills and  valleys,  richly  covered\\r\\nwith grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees,\\r\\nthe sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept  them  cool,  and\\r\\nFord  Prefect  had  checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic at less and\\r\\nless  frequent  intervals,  and  had  exhibited  less  and   less\\r\\nannoyance  at its continued silence. He was beginning to think he\\r\\nliked it here.\\r\\n \\r\\nCool though the night air was they slept soundly and  comfortably\\r\\nin  the  open  and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall\\r\\nfeeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some  small  rolls\\r\\ninto  his  satchel  at  Milliways  and they breakfasted off those\\r\\nbefore moving on.\\r\\n \\r\\nSo far they had wandered purely at random, but  now  they  struck\\r\\nout  firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore\\r\\nthis world they should have some clear idea  of  where  they  had\\r\\ncome from and where they were going.\\r\\n \\r\\nShortly before noon they had  their  first  indication  that  the\\r\\nworld  they  had  landed  on  was  not an uninhabited one: a half\\r\\nglimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them.  It  vanished  at\\r\\nthe  moment  they  both saw it, but the image they were both left\\r\\nwith was of a humanoid creature, curious  to  see  them  but  not\\r\\nalarmed.  Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and\\r\\nten minutes after that another.\\r\\n \\r\\nA minute later they stumbled into a  wide  clearing  and  stopped\\r\\nshort.\\r\\n \\r\\nBefore them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of  about\\r\\ntwo  dozen  men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford\\r\\nand Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small  children\\r\\nand  behind  the  group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings\\r\\nmade of mud and branches.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord and Arthur held their breath.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe tallest of the men stood a little over five feet  high,  they\\r\\nall  stooped  forward  slightly,  had  longish  arms  and  lowish\\r\\nforeheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared  intently\\r\\nat the strangers.\\r\\n \\r\\nSeeing that they carried no weapons  and  made  no  move  towards\\r\\nthem, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor a while the two groups simply stared at each  other,  neither\\r\\nside   making  any  move.  The  natives  seemed  puzzled  by  the\\r\\nintruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were\\r\\nquite clearly not issuing any invitations.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor a full two minutes nothing continued to happen.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe women drew their children slightly closer to them.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe men made hardly any discernible  move  and  yet  their  whole\\r\\ndisposition  made it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it\\r\\nwas not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome.\\r\\n \\r\\nOne of the men, who had been standing  slightly  forward  of  the\\r\\nrest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader,\\r\\nstepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh,\" he said quietly.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving\\r\\nan  instantaneous  and  unconscious  translation of everything he\\r\\nheard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased  to\\r\\nbe  aware  of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by\\r\\nthe fact that it didn\\'t seem to  be  working.  Vague  shadows  of\\r\\nmeaning  had  flickered  at  the  back of his mind, but there was\\r\\nnothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly  as\\r\\nit happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the\\r\\nbarest rudiments  of  language,  and  that  the  Babel  Fish  was\\r\\ntherefore  powerless  to  help.  He  glanced  at  Ford,  who  was\\r\\ninfinitely more experienced in these matters.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think,\" said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, \"he\\'s asking\\r\\nus if we\\'d mind walking on round the edge of the village.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nA moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ruurgggghhhh  urrgggh;  urgh  urgh  (uh  ruh)   rruurruuh   ug,\"\\r\\ncontinued the man-creature.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The general gist,\" said Ford, \"as far as I can make out, is that\\r\\nwe are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if\\r\\nwe would walk round his village rather than through it  it  would\\r\\nmake them all very happy.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So what do we do?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think we make them happy,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nSlowly and watchfully they walked  round  the  perimeter  of  the\\r\\nclearing.  This  seemed to go down very well with the natives who\\r\\nbowed to them very slightly and then went about their business.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord and Arthur continued their journey through the wood.  A  few\\r\\nhundred  yards  past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small\\r\\npile  of  fruit  lying  in  their  path  -  berries  that  looked\\r\\nremarkably  like  raspberries  and blackberries, and pulpy, green\\r\\nskinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears.\\r\\n \\r\\nSo far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries  they  had\\r\\nseen, though the trees and bushed were laden with them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look at it this way,\" Ford Prefect had said, \"fruit and  berries\\r\\non  strange  planets  either  make  you  live  or  make  you die.\\r\\nTherefore the point at which to start toying with  them  is  when\\r\\nyou\\'re  going  to  die if you don\\'t. That way you stay ahead. The\\r\\nsecret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It\\r\\nlooked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look at it this way,\" said Ford, \"er ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get\\r\\nto eat it,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the  pulp  skins  of  the  things\\r\\nwhich looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries\\r\\nand strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur  had  ever\\r\\nseen, even in ice cream commercials.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why don\\'t we eat them and think about it afterwards?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Maybe that\\'s what they want us to do.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright, look at it this way ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Sounds good so far.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s there for us to eat. Either it\\'s good or it\\'s  bad,  either\\r\\nthey  want  to  feed us or to poison us. If it\\'s poisonous and we\\r\\ndon\\'t eat it they\\'ll just attack us some other way. If  we  don\\'t\\r\\neat, we lose out either way.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I like the way you\\'re thinking,\" said Ford, \"Now eat one.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like\\r\\npears.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I always thought that about the  Garden  of  Eden  story,\"  said\\r\\nFord.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Eh?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes of course I do.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and\\r\\nsays do what you like guys, oh, but don\\'t eat the apple. Surprise\\r\\nsurprise, they eat it  and  he  leaps  out  from  behind  a  bush\\r\\nshouting  `Gotcha\\'.  It wouldn\\'t have made any difference if they\\r\\nhadn\\'t eaten it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Because if you\\'re dealing with somebody  who  has  the  sort  of\\r\\nmentality  which  likes  leaving hats on the pavement with bricks\\r\\nunder them you know perfectly well they won\\'t  give  up.  They\\'ll\\r\\nget you in the end.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are you talking about?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Never mind, eat the fruit.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Eat the fruit.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Sounds quite like it too.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s a pear,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nA few moments later, when they had eaten the  lot,  Ford  Prefect\\r\\nturned round and called out.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thank you. Thank you very much,\" he called, \"you\\'re very kind.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey went on their way.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they  kept  on\\r\\nfinding  the  occasional  gift  of fruit lying in their path, and\\r\\nthough they once or twice had a quick glimpse of  a  native  man-\\r\\ncreature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact.\\r\\nThey decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear\\r\\nthat they were grateful simply to be left alone.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was\\r\\nwhere the sea started.\\r\\n \\r\\nHaving no pressing calls on their time  they  built  a  raft  and\\r\\ncrossed  the  sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles\\r\\nwide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing,  landing  in  a\\r\\ncountry that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left.\\r\\n \\r\\nLife was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a  while  at  least\\r\\nthey  were  able  to  cope  with  the problems of aimlessness and\\r\\nisolation by deciding  to  ignore  them.  When  the  craving  for\\r\\ncompany  became  too  great they would know where to find it, but\\r\\nfor the moment they were happy to feel  that  the  Golgafrinchans\\r\\nwere hundreds of miles behind them.\\r\\n \\r\\nNevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic\\r\\nmore often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was\\r\\nso faint and from such enormous distance that  it  depressed  him\\r\\nmore than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken.\\r\\n \\r\\nOn a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling  they\\r\\ncame to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time\\r\\nit was harder going,  the  climate  was  getting  colder.  Arthur\\r\\nsuspected  a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect - the increasing\\r\\ndifficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense  of  purpose\\r\\nthat was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly.\\r\\n \\r\\nTheir journey northwards  brought  them  into  steep  mountainous\\r\\nterrain  of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow\\r\\ncovered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite  into\\r\\ntheir bones.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey wrapped themselves in  animal  skins  and  furs  which  Ford\\r\\nPrefect  acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of\\r\\nex-Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in  the  Hills  of\\r\\nHunian.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all  on  the  make,\\r\\nbecause the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a\\r\\nform of devotional discipline are,  frankly,  sensational  -  and\\r\\nextraordinary  numbers  of  monks leave the Order just after they\\r\\nhave finished their devotional training and just before they take\\r\\ntheir final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest\\r\\nof their lives.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord\\'s technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a\\r\\nwhile and smiling.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from  out\\r\\nof  the  trees  and  watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to\\r\\nsmile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he  would  seem\\r\\nto radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to\\r\\nembrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would  descend  on\\r\\nthe  surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from\\r\\nthis transfigured man. Slowly the deer would  approach,  step  by\\r\\nstep,  until  it  was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect\\r\\nwould reach out to it and break its neck.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pheromone control,\" he said it was, \"you just have to  know  how\\r\\nto generate the right smell.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n \\r\\nA few days after landing in this  mountainous  land  they  hit  a\\r\\ncoastline  which swept diagonally before them from the south-west\\r\\nto the north-east,  a  coastline  of  monumental  grandeur:  deep\\r\\nmajestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice - fjords.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor two further days they scrambled and climbed  over  the  rocks\\r\\nand glaciers, awe-struck with beauty.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Arthur!\" yelled Ford suddenly.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting  on  a\\r\\nhigh rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the\\r\\ncraggy promontories.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Arthur!\" yelled Ford again.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur looked to  where  Ford\\'s  voice  had  come  from,  carried\\r\\nfaintly in the wind.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur  found  him  there\\r\\ncrouching  by  the  solid  wall  of  blue  ice. He was tense with\\r\\nexcitement - his eyes darted up to meet Arthur\\'s.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look,\" he said, \"look!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"it\\'s a glacier. I\\'ve already seen it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Ford, \"you\\'ve looked  at  it,  you  haven\\'t  seen  it.\\r\\nLook!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord was pointing deep into the heart of the ice.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Move back from it,\" insisted Ford, \"look again.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur moved back and looked again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" he said, and shrugged. \"What am I supposed  to  be  looking\\r\\nfor?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd suddenly he saw it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You see it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe saw it.\\r\\n \\r\\nHis mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it  hadn\\'t  got\\r\\nanything  to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to\\r\\ncontend with the problem of what  his  eyes  told  it  they  were\\r\\nlooking  at,  but  in  doing so relinquished control of the mouth\\r\\nwhich promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up  the  jaw,\\r\\nhis  brain  lost  control  of  his  left hand which then wandered\\r\\naround in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain  tried\\r\\nto  catch  the  left  hand  without  letting  go of the mouth and\\r\\nsimultaneously tried to think about what was buried in  the  ice,\\r\\nwhich  is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully\\r\\nto the ground.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe thing that had been causing  all  this  neural  upset  was  a\\r\\nnetwork  of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the\\r\\nsurface. Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the\\r\\nsolid  shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three\\r\\nfeet  high;  and  for  those,  like  Arthur,  who  couldn\\'t  read\\r\\nMagrathean  there  was  above  the  letters the outline of a face\\r\\nhanging in the ice.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was an old face, thin  and  distinguished,  careworn  but  not\\r\\nunkind.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the\\r\\ncoastline they now knew themselves to be standing on.\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n \\r\\nA thin whine filled the air. It whirled and  howled  through  the\\r\\ntrees  upsetting  the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust.\\r\\nThe noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it\\r\\nrasped, it generally offended.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe  Captain,  however,  regarded  the  lone  bagpiper  with   an\\r\\nindulgent  eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once\\r\\nhe had got over  the  loss  of  his  gorgeous  bath  during  that\\r\\nunpleasantness  in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to\\r\\nfind his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped\\r\\nout  of  a  large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing,\\r\\nand in this he would bask daily whilst attendants  sloshed  water\\r\\nover  him.  Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they\\r\\nhadn\\'t yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would\\r\\ncome,  and  in  the  meantime  search  parties  were scouring the\\r\\ncountryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably  one  in  a\\r\\nnice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - perfection. To\\r\\nthose who said that they had  a  feeling  soap  wasn\\'t  found  in\\r\\nmines,  the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was\\r\\nbecause no one had looked hard enough, and this  possibility  had\\r\\nbeen reluctantly acknowledged.\\r\\n \\r\\nNo, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about  it  was\\r\\nthat  when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en\\r\\nsuite,  and  when  in  the  fullness  of  time   the   cry   came\\r\\nreverberating  across  the  hills  that  the  soap  mine had been\\r\\nlocated and was producing five hundred cakes a day  it  would  be\\r\\nmore pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look\\r\\nforward to.\\r\\n \\r\\nWail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the  bagpipes,\\r\\nincreasing  the  Captain\\'s  already  considerable pleasure at the\\r\\nthought that any moment now they might stop. That  was  something\\r\\nhe looked forward to as well.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so  many  things:\\r\\nthe  red  and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching;\\r\\nthe peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a\\r\\ncouple  of  hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing\\r\\nart director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six\\r\\nshiny  telephones  lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath.\\r\\nThe only thing nicer than a phone that didn\\'t ring all  the  time\\r\\n(or  indeed  at all) was six phones that didn\\'t ring all the time\\r\\n(or indeed at all).\\r\\n \\r\\nNicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of  people\\r\\nslowly  assembling  in  the  clearing  around  him  to  watch the\\r\\nafternoon committee meeting.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on  the  beak.  The\\r\\nafternoon committee meetings were his favourite.\\r\\n \\r\\nOther eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree  on  the\\r\\nedge  of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from\\r\\nforeign climes. After his six  month  journey  he  was  lean  and\\r\\nhealthy,  his  eyes  gleamed,  he  wore a reindeer-skin coat; his\\r\\nbeard was as thick and his face  as  bronzed  as  a  country-rock\\r\\nsinger\\'s.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe and Arthur Dent  had  been  watching  the  Golgafrinchans  for\\r\\nalmost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe clearing was now full. Hundreds  of  men  and  women  lounged\\r\\naround,  chatting,  eating  fruit,  playing  cards  and generally\\r\\nhaving a fairly relaxed time of it. Their track  suits  were  now\\r\\nall  dirty  and  even  torn, but they all had immaculately styled\\r\\nhair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their\\r\\ntrack  suits  full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be\\r\\nsome form of insulation against the coming  winter.  Ford\\'s  eyes\\r\\nnarrowed. They couldn\\'t be interested in botany of a sudden could\\r\\nthey?\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the middle of these  speculations  the  Captain\\'s  voice  rose\\r\\nabove the hubbub.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" he said, \"I\\'d like to call this meeting to  some  sort\\r\\nof  order  if  that\\'s  at  all  possible.  Is  that  alright with\\r\\neverybody?\" He smiled genially. \"In a  minute.  When  you\\'re  all\\r\\nready.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe talking gradually died away and  the  clearing  fell  silent,\\r\\nexcept  for  the  bagpiper  who  seemed  to  be  in some wild and\\r\\nuninhabitable musical world of his own. A few  of  those  in  his\\r\\nimmediate  vicinity  threw  some  leaves to him. If there was any\\r\\nreason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment.\\r\\n \\r\\nA small group of people had clustered round the Captain  and  one\\r\\nof  them  was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing\\r\\nup, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance  as\\r\\nif  to  signify  to  the  crowd  that  he would be with them in a\\r\\nminute.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe crowd of course were riveted and all  turned  their  eyes  on\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n \\r\\nA moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be  the  right\\r\\ndramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord dropped down out of the tree.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hi there,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe crowd swivelled round.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah my dear fellow,\" called out the Captain, \"Got any matches  on\\r\\nyou? Or a lighter? Anything like that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn\\'t what  he\\'d\\r\\nprepared.  He  decided  he\\'d  better  be a little stronger on the\\r\\nsubject.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No I haven\\'t,\" he continued, \"No matches. Instead  I  bring  you\\r\\nnews ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Pity,\" said the Captain, \"We\\'ve all run out you see. Haven\\'t had\\r\\na hot bath in weeks.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord refused to be headed off.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I bring you news,\" he said, \"of a discovery that might  interest\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is it on the agenda?\" snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord smiled a broad country-rock singer smile.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Now, come on,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well I\\'m sorry,\" said  the  man  huffily,  \"but  speaking  as  a\\r\\nmanagement  consultant  of many years\\' standing, I must insist on\\r\\nthe importance of observing the committee structure.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord looked round the crowd.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"He\\'s mad you know,\" he said, \"this is a prehistoric planet.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Address the chair!\" snapped the management consultant.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There isn\\'t chair,\" explained Ford, \"there\\'s only a rock.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe management consultant decided that  testiness  was  what  the\\r\\nsituation now called for.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, call it a chair,\" he said testily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why not call it a rock?\" asked Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You  obviously  have  no  conception,\"   said   the   management\\r\\nconsultant,  not  abandoning  testiness  in  favour  of  good old\\r\\nfashioned hauteur, \"of modern business methods.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And you have no conception of where you are,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nA girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Shut up, you two,\" she said, \"I want to table a motion.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean boulder a motion,\" tittered a hairdresser.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Order, order!\" yapped the management consultant.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" said Ford, \"let\\'s see how you are doing.\"  He  plonked\\r\\nhimself  down  on  the  ground  to see how long he could keep his\\r\\ntemper.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I would like to call to order,\" he said  pleasantly,  \"the  five\\r\\nhundred  and  seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee\\r\\nof Fintlewoodlewix ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nTen seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This is futile,\" he exclaimed, \"five hundred  and  seventy-three\\r\\ncommittee meetings and you haven\\'t even discovered fire yet!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If you would care,\" said the girl with the strident  voice,  \"to\\r\\nexamine the agenda sheet ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Agenda rock,\" trilled the hairdresser happily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thank you, I\\'ve made that point,\" muttered Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"... you ... will ... see ...\" continued the girl  firmly,  \"that\\r\\nwe  are  having  a report from the hairdressers\\' Fire Development\\r\\nSub-Committee today.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh ... ah -\" said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which  is\\r\\nrecognized  the  whole  Galaxy  over  as  meaning  \"Er, will next\\r\\nTuesday do?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright,\" said Ford, rounding on him, \"what have you done?  What\\r\\nare you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well I don\\'t know,\" said the hairdresser, \"All they gave me  was\\r\\na couple of sticks ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So what have you done with them?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nNervously, the hairdresser fished  in  his  track  suit  top  and\\r\\nhanded over the fruits of his labour to Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord held them up for all to see.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Curling tongs,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe crowd applauded.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Never mind,\" said Ford, \"Rome wasn\\'t burnt in a day.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe crowd hadn\\'t the faintest idea what he was talking about, but\\r\\nthey loved it nevertheless. They applauded.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, you\\'re obviously being totally naive of course,\" said  the\\r\\ngirl,  \"When  you\\'ve  been  in marketing as long as I have you\\'ll\\r\\nknow that before any new product can be developed it  has  to  be\\r\\nproperly  researched. We\\'ve got to find out what people want from\\r\\nfire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe crowd were tense. They  were  expecting  something  wonderful\\r\\nfrom Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Stick it up your nose,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,\"  insisted\\r\\nthe girl, \"Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do you?\" Ford asked the crowd.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes!\" shouted some.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No!\" shouted others happily.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey didn\\'t know, they just thought it was great.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And the wheel,\" said the Captain, \"What about this wheel thingy?\\r\\nIt sounds a terribly interesting project.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah,\" said the marketing  girl,  \"Well,  we\\'re  having  a  little\\r\\ndifficulty there.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Difficulty?\" exclaimed Ford,  \"Difficulty?  What  do  you  mean,\\r\\ndifficulty?  It\\'s  the  single  simplest  machine  in  the entire\\r\\nUniverse!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe marketing girl soured him with a look.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright, Mr Wiseguy,\" she said, \"you\\'re so clever, you  tell  us\\r\\nwhat colour it should have.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought.  Ford\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders and sat down again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Almighty Zarquon,\" he said, \"have none of you done anything?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAs if in answer to his question there was  a  sudden  clamour  of\\r\\nnoise  from  the  entrance  to  the  clearing. The crowd couldn\\'t\\r\\nbelieve the  amount  of  entertainment  they  were  getting  this\\r\\nafternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the\\r\\nremnants of their  Golgafrincham  3rd  Regiment  dress  uniforms.\\r\\nAbout  half  of  them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now\\r\\ncarried spears which they struck together as they  marched.  They\\r\\nlooked  bronzed,  healthy,  and utterly exhausted and bedraggled.\\r\\nThey clattered to a halt and banged to  attention.  One  of  them\\r\\nfell over and never moved again.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Captain, sir!\" cried Number Two - for  he  was  their  leader  -\\r\\n\"Permission to report sir!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot\\r\\nsprings?\" said the Captain despondently.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No sir!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thought you wouldn\\'t.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nNumber Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the\\r\\nbath.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We have discovered another continent!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"When was this?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It lies across the sea ...\" said Number Two, narrowing his  eyes\\r\\nsignificantly, \"to the east!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nNumber Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above  his\\r\\nhead. This is going to be great, thought the crowd.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We have declared war on it!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nWild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the  clearing\\r\\n- this was beyond all expectation.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Wait a minute,\" shouted Ford Prefect, \"wait a minute!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while  he  got\\r\\nit,  or  at  least  the  best silence he could hope for under the\\r\\ncircumstances: the  circumstances  were  that  the  bagpiper  was\\r\\nspontaneously composing a national anthem.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do we have to have the piper?\" demanded Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes,\" said the Captain, \"we\\'ve given him a grant.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord considered opening this  idea  up  for  debate  but  quickly\\r\\ndecided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged\\r\\nrock at the piper and turned to face Number Two.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"War?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes!\" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"On the next continent?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But there\\'s no one even living there yet!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAh, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point.\\r\\n \\r\\nNumber Two\\'s gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect  his  eyes\\r\\nwere  like  a  couple  of mosquitos that hover purposefully three\\r\\ninches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes,\\r\\nfly swats or rolled newspapers.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I know that,\" he said, \"but there will be one day!  So  we  have\\r\\nleft an open-ended ultimatum.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And blown up a few military installations.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain leaned forward out of his bath.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Military installations Number Two?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor a moment the eyes wavered.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes sir, well  potential  military  installations.  Alright  ...\\r\\ntrees.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe moment of uncertainty passed - his eyes flickered like  whips\\r\\nover his audience.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And,\" he roared, \"we interrogated a gazelle!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm  and  marched\\r\\noff  through  the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the\\r\\necstatic crowd. A few steps was all  he  managed  before  he  was\\r\\ncaught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the\\r\\nclearing.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So what else have you done?\" he inquired after the  celebrations\\r\\nhad died down.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We have started a culture,\" said the marketing girl.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes?\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes. One of our film producers is already making  a  fascinating\\r\\ndocumentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They\\'re not cavemen.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They look like cavemen.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do they live in caves?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They live in huts.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Perhaps they\\'re having their caves redecorated,\"  called  out  a\\r\\nwag from the crowd.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord rounded on him angrily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Very funny,\" he said, \"but have you noticed that  they\\'re  dying\\r\\nout?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nOn their journey back,  Ford  and  Arthur  had  come  across  two\\r\\nderelict  villages  and  the bodies of many natives in the woods,\\r\\nwhere they had crept away to die. Those  that  still  lived  were\\r\\nstricken  and listless, as if they were suffering some disease of\\r\\nthe spirit rather than the body. They moved sluggishly  and  with\\r\\nan infinite sadness. Their future had been taken away from them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Dying out!\" repeated Ford. \"Do you know what that means?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er ... we shouldn\\'t sell them any life  insurance?\"  called  out\\r\\nthe wag again.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Can you try and understand,\" he  said,  \"that  it\\'s  just  since\\r\\nwe\\'ve arrived that they\\'ve started dying out!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"In fact that comes over terribly well in this  film,\"  said  the\\r\\nmarketing  girl,  \"and just gives it that poignant twist which is\\r\\nthe hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer\\'s very\\r\\ncommitted.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"He should be,\" muttered Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I gather,\" said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was\\r\\nbeginning  to nod off, \"that he wants to make one about you next,\\r\\nCaptain.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh really?\" he said, coming to with  a  start,  \"that\\'s  awfully\\r\\nnice.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"He\\'s got a very strong angle on it,  you  know,  the  burden  of\\r\\nresponsibility, the loneliness of command ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well, I wouldn\\'t overstress  that  angle,  you  know,\"  he  said\\r\\nfinally, \"one\\'s never alone with a rubber duck.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from  the\\r\\ncrowd.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll the while, the Management  Consultant  had  been  sitting  in\\r\\nstony silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate\\r\\nthat he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt this point he decided he would not wait all day after all,  he\\r\\nwould merely pretend that the last half hour hadn\\'t happened.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe rose to his feet.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If,\" he said tersely, \"we could for a  moment  move  on  to  the\\r\\nsubject of fiscal policy ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Fiscal policy!\" whooped Ford Prefect, \"Fiscal policy!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Management Consultant gave him a look that  only  a  lungfish\\r\\ncould have copied.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Fiscal policy ...\" he repeated, \"that is what I said.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"How can you have money,\" demanded Ford, \"if none of you actually\\r\\nproduces anything? It doesn\\'t grow on trees you know.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If you would allow me to continue ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord nodded dejectedly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as\\r\\nlegal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord  stared  in  disbelief  at  the  crowd  who  were  murmuring\\r\\nappreciatively  at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves\\r\\nwith which their track suits were stuffed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But we have also,\" continued  the  Management  Consultant,  \"run\\r\\ninto  a  small  inflation problem on account of the high level of\\r\\nleaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current  going\\r\\nrate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship\\'s\\r\\npeanut.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nMurmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The  Management  Consultant\\r\\nwaved them down.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So in  order  to  obviate  this  problem,\"  he  continued,  \"and\\r\\neffectively  revaluate  the  leaf,  we  are  about to embark on a\\r\\nmassive defoliation campaign, and  ...  er,  burn  down  all  the\\r\\nforests.  I  think  you\\'ll all agree that\\'s a sensible move under\\r\\nthe circumstances.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for  a  second  or\\r\\ntwo  until  someone  pointed out how much this would increase the\\r\\nvalue of the leaves in  their  pockets  whereupon  they  let  out\\r\\nwhoops  of  delight and gave the Management Consultant a standing\\r\\novation.  The  accountants  amongst  them  looked  forward  to  a\\r\\nprofitable Autumn.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re all mad,\" explained Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re absolutely barmy,\" he suggested.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re a bunch of raving nutters,\" he opined.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe tide of opinion started to turn against him. What had started\\r\\nout  as  excellent  entertainment  had  now, in the crowd\\'s view,\\r\\ndeteriorated into mere abuse, and since this  abuse  was  in  the\\r\\nmain directed at them they wearied of it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Is it perhaps in order,\" she demanded, \"to inquire  what  you\\'ve\\r\\nbeen  doing  all these months then? You and that other interloper\\r\\nhave been missing since the day we arrived.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We\\'ve been on a journey,\" said Ford, \"We went to  try  and  find\\r\\nout something about this planet.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh,\" said the girl archly, \"doesn\\'t  sound  very  productive  to\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No? Well have I got news for you, my love.  We  have  discovered\\r\\nthis planet\\'s future.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn\\'t have\\r\\nany. They didn\\'t know what he was talking about.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe continued.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter a pair of fetid dingo\\'s kidneys what  you  all\\r\\nchoose  to  do  from  now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it\\r\\nwon\\'t make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already\\r\\nhappened.  Two million years you\\'ve got and that\\'s it. At the end\\r\\nof that time your race will be dead, gone and  good  riddance  to\\r\\nyou. Remember that, two million years!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they\\r\\nhad  suddenly  become shouldn\\'t be obliged to listen to this sort\\r\\nof gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and\\r\\nhe would go away.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey didn\\'t need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of  the\\r\\nclearing,  pausing  only  to shake his head at Number Two who was\\r\\nalready firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe turned back once.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Two million years!\" he said and laughed.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Captain with a soothing smile, \"still time for a\\r\\nfew  more baths. Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped\\r\\nit over the side.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n \\r\\nA mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent  was  too  busily\\r\\nengrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on\\r\\na  wide  flat  piece  of rock he had scratched out the shape of a\\r\\nlarge square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine  smaller\\r\\nsquares, thirteen to a side.\\r\\n \\r\\nFurthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish\\r\\nstones  and  scratched  the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting\\r\\nmorosely round the rock were a  couple  of  the  surviving  local\\r\\nnative  men  whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious\\r\\nconcept embodied in these stones.\\r\\n \\r\\nSo far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some  of\\r\\nthem,  bury  others  and  throw the rest of them away. Arthur had\\r\\nfinally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones  on  the\\r\\nboard  he  had  scratched  out, which was not even as far as he\\'d\\r\\nmanaged to get the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration\\r\\nin   the  morale  of  these  creatures,  there  seemed  to  be  a\\r\\ncorresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn an attempt to egg them along,  Arthur  set  out  a  number  of\\r\\nletters  on  the  board  himself, and then tried to encourage the\\r\\nnatives to add some more themselves.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was not going well.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord watched quietly from beside a nearby tree.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Arthur to one of the natives  who  had  just  shuffled\\r\\nsome  of  the  letters  round  in  a fit of abysmal dejection, \"Q\\r\\nscores ten you see, and it\\'s on a triple word score, so ... look,\\r\\nI\\'ve  explained the rules to you ... no no, look please, put down\\r\\nthat  jawbone  ...  alright,  we\\'ll  start  again.  And  try   to\\r\\nconcentrate this time.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand  against  his\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are you doing, Arthur?\" he asked quietly.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all\\r\\nthis  might  look  slightly  foolish. All he knew was that it had\\r\\nworked like a dream on him when he was a chid.  But  things  were\\r\\ndifferent then, or rather would be.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They\\'re not cavemen,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They look like cavemen.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord let it pass.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I see,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s uphill work,\" said Arthur wearily, \"the only word they know\\r\\nis grunt and they can\\'t spell it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe sighed and sat back.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s that supposed to achieve?\" asked Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We\\'ve got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!\" Arthur burst\\r\\nout  angrily.  He  hoped  that  the weary sigh and then the anger\\r\\nmight do  something  to  counteract  the  overriding  feeling  of\\r\\nfoolishness  from which he was currently suffering. It didn\\'t. He\\r\\njumped to his feet.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from  those\\r\\n... cretins we arrived with?\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Imagine?\" said Ford, rising his  eyebrows.  \"We  don\\'t  have  to\\r\\nimagine. We\\'ve seen it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But ...\" Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"We\\'ve seen it,\" said Ford, \"there\\'s no escape.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur kicked at a stone.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Did you tell them what we\\'ve discovered?\" he asked.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hmmmm?\" said Ford, not really concentrating.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Norway,\"  said  Arthur,  \"Slartibartfast\\'s  signature   in   the\\r\\nglacier. Did you tell them?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s the point?\" said Ford, \"What would it mean to them?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Mean?\" said Arthur, \"Mean?  You  know  perfectly  well  what  it\\r\\nmeans. It means that this planet is the Earth! It\\'s my home! It\\'s\\r\\nwhere I was born!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Was?\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Alright, will be.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, in two million years\\' time. Why don\\'t you tell  them  that?\\r\\nGo  and  say to them, `Excuse me, I\\'d just like to point out that\\r\\nin two million years\\' time I will be born just a few  miles  from\\r\\nhere.\\'  See  what  they  say. They\\'ll chase you up a tree and set\\r\\nfire to it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur absorbed this unhappily.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Face it,\" said Ford, \"those zeebs over there are your ancestors,\\r\\nnot these poor creatures here.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe went  over  to  where  the  apemen  creatures  were  rummaging\\r\\nlistlessly with the stone letters. He shook his head.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Put the Scrabble away, Arthur,\" he  said,  \"it  won\\'t  save  the\\r\\nhuman  race,  because this lot aren\\'t going to be the human race.\\r\\nThe human race is currently sitting round a  rock  on  the  other\\r\\nside of this hill making documentaries about themselves.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur winced.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There must be something we can do,\" he said. A terrible sense of\\r\\ndesolation  thrilled  through his body that he should be here, on\\r\\nthe Earth, the Earth which had lost its future  in  a  horrifying\\r\\narbitrary  catastrophe  and which now seemed set to lose its past\\r\\nas well.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No,\" said Ford, \"there\\'s nothing we can do. This doesn\\'t  change\\r\\nthe  history  of  the  Earth, you see, this is the history of the\\r\\nEarth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you\\r\\nare  descended  from.  in two million years they get destroyed by\\r\\nthe Vogons. History is  never  altered  you  see,  it  just  fits\\r\\ntogether like a jigsaw. Funny old thing, life, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush\\r\\nwhere it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and\\r\\ndidn\\'t stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which  choked\\r\\non  one  of  its  bones  and  died  on the bank of a stream which\\r\\nsubsequently washed it away.\\r\\n \\r\\nDuring the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his  pride  and\\r\\nstruck  up  a  relationship  with a girl who had been a personnel\\r\\nofficer on Golgafrincham, and he  was  terribly  upset  when  she\\r\\nsuddenly  passed  away  as a result of drinking water from a pool\\r\\nthat had been polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only  moral\\r\\nit  is  possible to draw from this story is that one should never\\r\\nthrow the letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are\\r\\ntimes when it is unavoidable.\\r\\n \\r\\nLike most of the really crucial things in  life,  this  chain  of\\r\\nevents  was completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.\\r\\nThey were looking sadly at one of the  natives  morosely  pushing\\r\\nthe other letters around.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Poor bloody caveman,\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They\\'re not ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh never mind.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged\\r\\non the rock.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn\\'t it?\"  said\\r\\nArthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Uh uh urghhhhh,\" muttered the native  and  banged  on  the  rock\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"They\\'ve been outevolved by telephone sanitizers.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Urgh, gr gr, gruh!\" insisted the native, continuing to  bang  on\\r\\nthe rock.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Why does he keep banging on the rock?\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again,\"  said\\r\\nFord, \"he\\'s pointing at the letters.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor  bastard.  I  keep  on\\r\\ntelling him there\\'s only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe native banged on the rock again.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey looked over his shoulder.\\r\\n \\r\\nTheir eyes popped.\\r\\n \\r\\nThere amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid\\r\\nout in a clear straight line.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey spelt two words.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe words were these:\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Forty-Two.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Grrrurgh guh guh,\" explained the native. He  swept  the  letters\\r\\nangrily  away  and  went and mooched under a nearby tree with his\\r\\ncolleague.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Did that say what I thought it said?\" they  both  said  to  each\\r\\nother.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes,\" they both said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Forty-two,\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Forty-two,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur ran over to the two natives.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What are you trying to tell us?\" he shouted. \"What\\'s it supposed\\r\\nto mean?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nOne of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in  the\\r\\nair, rolled over again and went to sleep.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts  at  Ford\\r\\nPrefect.  Whatever  it was they had to say, they had already said\\r\\nit.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You know what this means,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Not entirely.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the  Ultimate\\r\\nAnswer.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built  to\\r\\ncalculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"So we are led to believe.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And organic life was part of the computer matrix.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"If you say so.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen are  an\\r\\nintegral  part  of  the  computer  program,  and  that we and the\\r\\nGolgafrinchans are not.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But the  cavemen  are  dying  out  and  the  Golgafrinchans  are\\r\\nobviously set to replace them.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Exactly. So do you see what this means?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Cock up,\" said Ford Prefect.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur looked around him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it,\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord puzzled for a moment.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Still, something must have come out of it,\"  he  said  at  last,\\r\\n\"because  Marvin  said  he could see the Question printed in your\\r\\nbrain wave patterns.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"But ...\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of  the  right  one.  It\\r\\nmight  give us a clue though if we could find it. I don\\'t see how\\r\\nwe can though.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThey moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and  started\\r\\npulling  up bits of grass, but found that it wasn\\'t an occupation\\r\\nhe could get deeply  engrossed  in.  It  wasn\\'t  grass  he  could\\r\\nbelieve  in, the trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed\\r\\nto be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a  tunnel  to\\r\\nbe crawled through.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It  was  silent.  He\\r\\nsighed and put it away.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur picked up one of the  letter  stones  from  his  home-made\\r\\nScrabble  set.  It  was a T. He sighed and out it down again. The\\r\\nletter he put down next to it was an I. That spelt IT. He  tossed\\r\\nanother couple of letters next to them They were an S and an H as\\r\\nit  happened.  By  a  curious  coincidence  the  resulting   word\\r\\nperfectly  expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just\\r\\nthen.  He  stared  at  it  for  a  moment.  He  hadn\\'t  done   it\\r\\ndeliberately,  it  was just a random chance. His brain got slowly\\r\\ninto first gear.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ford,\" he said suddenly, \"look, if that Question is  printed  in\\r\\nmy  brain  wave  patterns  but I\\'m not consciously aware of it it\\r\\nmust be somewhere in my unconscious.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, I suppose so.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"There might be  a  way  of  bringing  that  unconscious  pattern\\r\\nforward.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh yes?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, by introducing some random element that can  be  shaped  by\\r\\nthat pattern.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Like how?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nFord leapt to his feet.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Brilliant!\" he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel  and\\r\\nwith a few deft knots transformed it into a bag.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Totally mad,\" he said, \"utter nonsense. But we\\'ll do it  because\\r\\nit\\'s brilliant nonsense. Come on, come on.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe sun passed respectfully behind  a  cloud.  A  few  small  sad\\r\\nraindrops fell.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey piled together all the remaining letters  and  dropped  them\\r\\ninto the bag. They shook them up.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Right,\" said Ford, \"close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on come\\r\\non, come on.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful  of\\r\\nstones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to\\r\\nFord. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"W,\" said Ford, \"H, A, T ... What!\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe blinked.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I think it\\'s working!\" he said.\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur pushed three more at him.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"D, O, Y ... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn\\'t working,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Here\\'s the next three.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"O, U, G ... Doyoug ... It\\'s not making sense I\\'m afraid.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"E, T, doyouget ... Do you get!\" shouted Ford,  \"it  is  working!\\r\\nThis is amazing, it really is working!\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"More here.\" Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as  fast  as\\r\\nhe could go.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I, F,\" said Ford, \"Y, O, U, ... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y, ... What\\r\\ndo  you  get if you multiply, ... S, I, X, ... six, B, Y, by, six\\r\\nby ... what do you get if you multiply six by ... N, I, N, E, ...\\r\\nsix by nine ...\" He paused. \"Come on, where\\'s the next one?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Er, that\\'s the lot,\" said Arthur, \"that\\'s all there were.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nHe sat back, nonplussed.\\r\\n \\r\\nHe rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were  no\\r\\nmore letters.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You mean that\\'s it?\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Six by nine. Forty-two.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s it. That\\'s all there is.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n=================================================================\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n \\r\\nThe sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A  bird  sang.  A\\r\\nwarm  breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the\\r\\nflowers, carrying their scent away through the woods.  An  insect\\r\\ndroned  past  on  its way to do whatever it is that insects do in\\r\\nthe late afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the  trees\\r\\nfollowed  a  moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at\\r\\nthe sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the\\r\\nground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, don\\'t go,\" called Ford Prefect between gasps, \"we\\'ll be with\\r\\nyou in a moment.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked one of the girls. She was  the  taller\\r\\nand  slimmer  of  the two. On Golgafrincham she had been a junior\\r\\npersonnel officer, but hadn\\'t liked it much.\\r\\n \\r\\nFord pulled himself together.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Excuse  me,\"  he  said,  \"hello.  My  friend  and  I  were  just\\r\\ncontemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh it\\'s you,\" said the girl, \"you made a bit of a  spectacle  of\\r\\nyourself  this  afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but\\r\\nyou did bang on a bit.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Did I? Oh yes.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, what was all that for?\" asked the  other  girl,  a  shorter\\r\\nround-faced  girl  who  had  been  an  art  director  for a small\\r\\nadvertising company on Golgafrincham. Whatever the privations  of\\r\\nthis  world  were,  she  went  to  sleep  every  night profoundly\\r\\ngrateful for the fact that  whatever  she  had  to  face  in  the\\r\\nmorning  it wouldn\\'t be a hundred almost identical photographs of\\r\\nmoodily lit tubes of toothpaste.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"For? For nothing. Nothing\\'s for  anything,\"  said  Ford  Prefect\\r\\nhappily.  \"Come  and  join  us. I\"m Ford, this is Arthur. We were\\r\\njust about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThe girls looked at them doubtfully.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'m Agda,\" said the tall one, \"this is Mella.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Hello Agda, hello Mella,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Do you talk at all?\" said Mella to Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, eventually,\" said Arthur with a smile, \"but not as  much  as\\r\\nFord.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Good.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nThere was a slight pause.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What did you mean,\" asked Agda, \"about only having  two  million\\r\\nyears? I couldn\\'t make sense of what you were saying.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh that,\" said Ford, \"it doesn\\'t matter.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It\\'s just that the world gets  demolished  to  make  way  for  a\\r\\nhyperspace  bypass,\"  said  Arthur  with a shrug, \"but that\\'s two\\r\\nmillion years away, and anyway it\\'s just Vogons doing what Vogons\\r\\ndo.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Vogons?\" said Mella.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, you wouldn\\'t know them.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Where\\'d you get this idea from?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"It really doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s just like a dream from the  past,\\r\\nor the future.\" Arthur smiled and looked away.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Does it worry you that you don\\'t talk any kind of sense?\"  asked\\r\\nAgda.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Listen, forget it,\"  said  Ford,  \"forget  all  of  it.  Nothing\\r\\nmatters. Look, it\\'s a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the green\\r\\nof the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Even if it\\'s only a dream, it\\'s a pretty  horrible  idea,\"  said\\r\\nMella, \"destroying a world just to make a bypass.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve heard of worse,\" said Ford, \"I read of one  planet  off\\r\\nin  the  seventh  dimension  that got used as a ball in a game of\\r\\nintergalactic bar billiards. Got potted  straight  into  a  black\\r\\nhole. Killed ten billion people.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That\\'s mad,\" said Mella.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, only scored thirty points too.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nAgda and Mella exchanged glances.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Look,\" said Agda, \"there\\'s a party after the  committee  meeting\\r\\ntonight. You can come along if you like.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yeah, OK,\" said Ford.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"I\\'d like to,\" said Arthur.\\r\\n \\r\\nMany hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the  moon  rise\\r\\nover the dull red glow of the trees.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"That story about the world being destroyed ...\" began Mella.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"In two million years, yes.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You say it as if you really think it\\'s true.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Yes, I think it is. I think I was there.\"\\r\\n \\r\\nShe shook her head in puzzlement.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"You\\'re very strange,\" she said.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"No, I\\'m very ordinary,\" said  Arthur,  \"but  some  very  strange\\r\\nthings  have happened to me. You could say I\\'m more differed from\\r\\nthan differing.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"And that other world your friend talked about, the one that  got\\r\\npushed into a black hole.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Ah, that I don\\'t know about. It sounds like something  from  the\\r\\nbook.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What book?\"\\r\\n \\r\\nArthur paused.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy,\" he said at last.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\r\\n \\r\\n\"Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I  don\\'t\\r\\nthink I\\'ll be wanting it any more,\" said Arthur Dent.\\r\\n'\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Crear Archivos excel o csv\n","import pandas as pd # Pandas es otra libreria que necesita ser installada.\n","\n","datos = pd.DataFrame({\n","  \"columna1\": [1, 3, 2],\n","  \"columna2\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n","})\n","datos.to_csv(\"mi_archivo.csv\", index=False)\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","datos = pd.read_csv(\"mi_archivo.csv\")\n","print(datos)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"adlqxne_O4VU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677681324911,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":698,"user":{"displayName":"Julio César Misael Monroy Gónzalez","userId":"16915888806011674090"}},"outputId":"6bf194e1-8674-490e-f115-364825357da7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["   columna1 columna2\n","0         1        A\n","1         3        B\n","2         2        C\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Tabla interactiva.\n","datos"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"wFY4JQAnPWk8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677681325249,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":344,"user":{"displayName":"Julio César Misael Monroy Gónzalez","userId":"16915888806011674090"}},"outputId":"e038a68a-0876-44ae-b0c5-72856d216985"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   columna1 columna2\n","0         1        A\n","1         3        B\n","2         2        C"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-5832f33a-4ec2-4050-850a-f02851a36865\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>columna1</th>\n","      <th>columna2</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>A</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>C</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-5832f33a-4ec2-4050-850a-f02851a36865')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-5832f33a-4ec2-4050-850a-f02851a36865 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
